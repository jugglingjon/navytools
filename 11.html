<h3>POWER DRILLS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<figure data-id="11-1" class="">Power drill.</figure>

<h5>Power Drill</h5>
<p>Power drills (Figure 11-1) have generally replaced hand tools for drilling holes because they are faster and more accurate. With variable speed controls and special clutch drive chucks, they can also be used as electric screwdrivers. More specialized power-driven screwdrivers are also available, which have greatly increased the efficiency of many fastening operations in construction work.</p>
 <figure data-id="11-2" class="">Light-duty power drill.</figure>
 <figure data-id="11-3" class="">Right angle drill.</figure>

<p>The two basic designs for portable electric drills are the spade design (Figure 11-1) for heavy-duty construction and the pistol-grip design (Figure 11-2) for lighter work. Sizes of power drills are based on the diameter of the largest drill shank that will fit into the chuck of the drill.</p>
<p>A right angle drill (Figure 11-3) is a specialty drill used in plumbing and electrical work. This drill allows you to drill holes at a right angle to the drill body.</p>
 <figure data-id="11-4" class="">Electric hammer drill.</figure>

<h5>Electric Hammer Drill</h5>
<p>The electric hammer drill (Figure 11-4) consists of the housing and a spade or pistol-grip handle. A strong spring inside the housing moves a steel piston back and forth in a pounding motion. The housing muzzle is designed to hold a variety of bits, which give the electric hammer great versatility. Examples of possible uses for this tool are beveling, pounding, digging, and breaking operations.</p>
 <figure data-id="11-5" class="">Electric impact wrench.</figure>

<h5>Electric Impact Wrench</h5>
<p>The electric impact wrench (Figure 11-5) consists of a pistol-grip handle on a housing, which contains a motor that energizes the driving anvil inside the muzzle of the housing. Attachments are fastened to the driving anvil by snapping them onto the socket retainer. The portable electric wrench with its accompanying equipment is primarily intended for applying and removing nuts, bolts, and screws. It may also be used to drill and tap wood, metal, plastics, and so forth, and to drive and remove socket head or self- tapping screws.</p>

<h3>ELECTRIC SAWS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Circular Saw</h5>
<p>The portable electric circular saw is used chiefly as a great labor-saving device in sawing wood framing members on the job. The size of a circular saw is determined by the diameter of the largest blade it can use. The most commonly used circular saws are the 7 1/4- and 8 1/4-inch saws. There are two different types of circular saws: the side drive, shown in Figure 11- 11, and the worm drive, shown in Figure 11-12.</p>
<figure data-id="11-13" class="">Circular saw blades.</figure>
<figure data-id="11-14" class="">Saber saw.</figure>

<p>Circular saws can use many different types of cutting blades, some of which are shown in Figure 11-13.</p>
<p>Combination crosscut and rip blades—combination blades are all- purpose blades for cutting thick and thin hardwoods and softwoods, both with or across the grain. They can also be used to cut plywood and hardboard.</p>
<p>Crosscut Blades—crosscut blades have fine teeth that cut smoothly across the grain of both hardwood and softwood. These blades can be used for plywood, veneers, and hardboard.</p>
<p>Rip Blades—rip blades have bigger teeth than combination blades and should be used only to cut with the grain. A rip fence or guide will help you make an accurate cut with this type of blade.</p>
<p>Hollow-Ground Blades—hollow-ground blades have no set. They make the smoothest cuts on thick or thin stock. Wood cut with these blades requires little or no sanding.</p>
<p>Abrasive Blades—abrasive blades are used for cutting metal, masonry, and plastics. These blades are particularly useful for scoring bricks so they can be easily split.</p>
<p>Make sure that the abrasive blade you choose has a revolution per minute rating at or above the revolution per minute rating of the saw. If the blade revolution per minute rating is lower than the revolution per minute rating of the saw, the blade can shatter or break, possibly causing injury or damage.</p>

<h5>Saber Saw</h5>
<p>The saber saw (Figure 11-14), is a power-driven jigsaw that cuts smooth and decorative curves in wood and light metal. Most saber saws are light-duty machines and are not designed for extremely fast cutting.</p>
<figure data-id="11-16" class="">Reciprocating saw.</figure>

<p>There are several different, easily interchangeable blades (Figure 11-15) designed to operate in the saber saw. Some blades are designed for cutting wood and some for cutting metal.</p>
<p>The best way to learn how to handle this type of tool is to use it. Before trying to do a finished job with the saber saw, clamp down a piece of scrap plywood and draw some curved as well as straight lines to follow. You will develop your own way of gripping the tool, which will be affected somewhat by the particular tool you are using. On some tools, for example, you will find guiding easier if you apply some downward pressure on the tool as you move it forward. If you do not use a firm grip, the tool will tend to vibrate excessively and roughen the cut. Do not force the cutting faster than the design of the blade allows, or you will break the blade.</p>
<p>You can make a pocket cut with a saber saw just like you can with a circular saw, although you need to drill a starter hole to begin work. A saber saw can also make bevel-angle and curve cuts.</p>

<h5>Reciprocating Saw</h5>
<p>The reciprocating saw (Figure 11-16) is a heavy- duty power tool used for a variety of woodworking maintenance work, remodeling, and roughing-in jobs. You can use it to cut rectangular or curved openings (along straight or curved lines) and to cut flush.</p>
<p>Blades for reciprocating saws are made in a great variety of sizes and shapes. They vary in length from 2 1/2 to 12 inches and are made of high-speed steel or carbon steel. They have cutting edges similar to those shown in Figure 11-15.</p>

<figure data-id="11-17" class="">Electric chain saw.</figure>

<h5>Electric Chain Saw</h5>
<p>The electrically driven chain saw (Figure 11-17) is a portable power saw with the teeth arranged on a flexible steel chainlike belt. It has a pistollike grip and bar frame above the motor housing for holding and guiding. Unlike the gasoline-powered chain saw, the electric chain saw is designed for lighter work, such as tree trimming and cutting small logs and timber.</p>
 
<h4>Using Portable Electric Saws</h4>
<h5>Using a Circular Saw</h5>
<p>The versatility of the circular saw is shown in Figure 11-18. To make an accurate ripping cut (Figure 11-18, view A), set the ripping guide a distance away from the saw equal to the width of the strip to be ripped off. Then place it against the edge of the piece as a guide for the saw. To make a bevel angle cut up to 45 degrees (Figure 11-18, view B), just set the bevel adjustment knob to the angle you want and cut down the line. To make a pocket cut (a square cut in the middle of a piece of material) (Figure 11-18, views C and D), retract the lower guard back and tilt the saw so that it rests on the front of the base. Lower the rear of the saw into the material until it goes all the way through the wood. Then, follow your layout line.</p>

<figure data-id="11-18" class="fullWidth">Different ways to use a circular saw.</figure>

<h5>Using a Reciprocating Saw</h5>
<p>Before operating this saw, be sure you are using a blade that is right for the job. The manufacturer’s instruction manual shows the proper saw blade to use for a particular material. The blade must be pushed securely into the opening provided. Rock it slightly to ensure a correct fit, and then tighten the setscrew.</p>
<p>To start a cut, place the saw blade near the material to be cut. Then, start the motor and move the blade into the material. Keep the cutting pressure constant, but do not overload the saw motor. Never reach underneath the material being cut.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">Keep the nose of the guide bar from contacting logs, branches, the ground, or other obstructions. This contact can cause kickback, which is a quick and dangerous upward movement of the guide bar and saw chain.</div>
    <div class="alert alert-caution">The saw chain should be at maximum speed before contacting working surface.</div>
    
    <li>Cut with the spike bar set firmly against the wood and apply light pressure.</li>
    
    <li>Continue to guide the chain saw through the work until the cut is completed.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Portable Electric Saws</h4>
<h5>Care of Circular Saws</h5>
<p>Observe the following safety precautions when operating a circular saw:</p>
    
<ul>
   <li>Examine power tool cords for exposed loose wires and damaged insulation.</li>
    
    <li>Wear goggles or face shields while using the saw and while cleaning up debris afterward.</li>
    
    <li>Before using the saw, carefully examine the material to be cut and free it of nails or other metal objects. Avoid cutting into or through knots, if possible.</li>
    
    <li>Inspect the electric cords that you use daily for any cuts or breaks. Before cutting boards, make sure the cord is not in the way of the blade.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure all circular saws are equipped with guards that automatically adjust themselves to the work when in use so that none of the teeth protrude above the work. Adjust the guard over the blade so that it slides out of its recess and covers the blade to the depth of the teeth when you lift the saw off the work.</li>
    
    <li>Disconnect the saw from its power source before making any adjustments or repairs to the saw, including inspecting and changing the blade.</li>
    
    <li>Inspect the blade at frequent intervals and always after it has locked, pinched, or burned the work.</li>
    
    <li>Grasp the saw with both hands and hold it firmly against the work. Take care to prevent the saw from breaking away from the work and thereby causing injury.</li>
    
    <li>Avoid forcing the saw through heavy cutting stock. You can overload the motor and damage it.</li></ul>

<h3>ROUTERS</h3>
<p>The router (Figure 11-21) is a versatile portable power tool that can be used free hand or with jigs and attachments. It consists of a motor containing a chuck into which the router bits are attached. The motor slides into the base in a vertical position. By means of the depth adjustment ring, easy regulation of the depth of a cut is possible. Routers vary in size from 1/4 to 2 1/2 horsepower, and the motor speed varies from 18,000 to 27,000 revolutions per minute.</p>
 	<figure data-id="11-21" class="">Portable router with edge guide.</figure>
<p>One of the most practical accessories for the router is the edge guide. It is used to guide the router in a straight line along the edge of the board. The edge guide is particularly useful for cutting grooves on long pieces of lumber. The two rods on the edge guide slip into the two holes provided on the router base. The edge guide can be adjusted to move in or out along the two rods to obtain the desired lateral depth cut.</p>

<p>There are two classifications of router bits: built-in (or shank-type) and screw-type. Built-in bits fit into the chuck of the router. Screw-type bits have a threaded hole through the center of the cutting head, which allows the cutting head to be screwed to the shank. A few of the most common router bits are shown in Figure 11-22.</p>
 
 <figure data-id="11-22" class="fullWidth">Common router bits.</figure>
 
<h4>Care of Routers</h4>
<p>Observe the following safety precautions when operating a router:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Examine power tool cords for exposed loose wires and damaged insulation.</li>
    
    <li>Before operating a router, be sure the work piece is well secured and free of obstruction.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure the router is disconnected from the power source before making any adjustment or changing bits.</li>
    
    <li>Use both hands to hold the router when cutting the material.</li>
    
    <li>Avoid overloading the router when cutting the material.</li></ul>
 <figure data-id="11-23" class="">Portable power plane.</figure>

<h3>POWER PLANE</h3>
<p>The portable electric power plane (Figure 11-23) is widely used for trimming panels, doors, frames, and so forth. It is a precision tool capable of exact cutting depth up to 3/16 inch on some of the heavier models. The maximum safe depth of cut on any model is 3/32 inch in any one pass. The power plane is a high-speed motor that drives a cutter bar, containing either straight or spiral blades, at high speed.</p>

<h4>Using a Power Plane</h4>
<p>Operating the power plane is a matter of setting the depth of cut and passing the plane over the work. The following steps describe how to use a power plane properly:</p>
    
<ol>
   <li>Make careful measurements of the piece and where it is to fit, and determine how much material has to be removed.</li>
    
    <li>The stock being planed should be held in a vise, clamped to the edge of a bench, or otherwise firmly held.</li>
    
    <li>Check the smoothness and straightness of all the edges.</li>
    
    <li>If a smoothing cut is desired, make that cut first and then recheck the dimensions. Make as many passes as necessary with the plane to reach the desired dimensions. Check frequently so you do not remove too much material. The greater the depth of the cut, the more slowly you must feed the tool into the work. Feed pressure should be enough to keep the tool cutting, but not so much as to slow it down excessively.</li>
    
    <li>Keep wood chips off the work because they can mar the surface of the stock as the tool passes over them.</li>
    
    <li>Keep your hands away from the cutter head or blades when a cut is finished.</li>
</ol>

<p>The L-shaped base, or fence, of the plane should be pressed snugly against the work when planing, assuring that the edge will be cut square. For bevel cuts, loosen the setscrew on the base, set the base at the desired bevel, and then retighten the setscrew.</p>
 
<h4>Care of Power Planes</h4>
<p>Observe the following safety precautions when operating a portable power plane:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Examine power tool cords for exposed loose wires and damaged insulation.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure that the plane is turned off before plugging it in.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure you disconnect the plug before making any adjustments.</li>
    
    <li>Always clamp your work securely in the best position to perform the planing.</li>
    
    <li>Use both hands to operate the power plane.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure you disconnect the power cord when you are finished planing.</li></ul>

<h3>SANDERS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>There are three types of portable sanders: belt, disk, and finish.</p>

<h5>Belt Sander</h5>
<p>When using a belt sander (Figure 11-24), be careful not to gouge the wood. The size of a belt sander is usually identified by the width of its sanding belt. Belt widths on heavier duty models are usually 3 or 4 inches. Depending on the make and model, belt lengths vary from 21 to 27 inches. Different grades of abrasives are available.</p>

<h5>Disk Sander</h5>
<p>The disk sander (Figure 11-25) is a useful tool for removing old finish, paint, and varnish from siding, wood flooring, and concrete. For best results with a disk sander, tip the machine lightly with just enough pressure to bend the disk. Use a long, sweeping motion, back and forth, advancing along the surface. When using a disk sander, always operate it with both hands.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h5>Finish Sander</h5>
<p>Finish sanders are used for light and fine sanding. Two kinds of finish sanders are available. The orbital sander (Figure 11-26) operates with an orbital or circular motion. The oscillating sander (Figure 11- 27) has a back-and-forth movement. Finish sanders use regular abrasive paper (sandpaper) cut to size from full sheets.</p>

<h3>GRINDERS</h3>
		<figure data-id="11-30" class="">Portable grinder.</figure>
		<figure data-id="11-31" class="">Rotary scaling and chipping tool.</figure>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Portable Grinder</h5>
<p>The most useful power tool for surface preparations is the portable grinder, as shown in Figure 11-30. This tool usually comes equipped with a grinding wheel that, for wire brushing purposes, is replaced by either the rotary wheel wire brush or the rotary cup wire brush. The light- duty brushes are made of crimped wire, and the heavy-duty brushes are made of tufts of wire formed by twisting together several strands of wire.</p>

<h5>Rotary Scaling Tool</h5>
<p>A rotary scaling and chipping tool (Figure 11-31), sometimes called a deck crawler, is powered electrically and has a bundle of cutters (or chippers) mounted on either side. In use, it is pushed along the surface to be scaled, with the rotating cutters doing the work. Replacement bundles of cutters are available.</p>
<p>Rotary scalers are used to remove rust, scale, and old paint from metallic and masonry surfaces. You must be especially careful when using these tools because they will "chew" up anything in their path. Avoid getting the power line or any part of your body in their way.</p>

<h4>Using a Portable Grinder</h4>
<p>Before operating a portable grinder, be sure you are using the proper disk. The manufacturer’s instruction manual shows the proper disk to use for grinding or cutting. The blade must be secured on the spindle. Make sure the work surface is secured to prevent movement.</p>
<p>To start grinding, hold the grinder firmly with both hands and place the disk near the working area. Start the motor and allow the grinder to reach the operating speed. Move the grinder across the work area, applying light pressure to prevent overheating the work and the disk. When you have finished grinding, lift the grinder off the surface of the work slowly.</p>

<h4>Care of Portable Grinders</h4>
<p>Observe the following safety tips when operating portable grinders:</p>
    
<ul>
   <li>Examine power tool cords for exposed loose wires and damaged insulation. Keep the electrical cord away from the business end of the grinder.</li>
    
    <li>Always wear eye protection when using portable grinders.</li>
    
    <li>Wear hearing protection, especially for extended operation.</li>
     
    
    <li>Wear respiratory protection while using a portable grinder.</li>
    
    <li>If you drop a portable grinder or a wheel, inspect it very carefully for damage.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure the grinder is off before plugging it in.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure the grinder is disconnected when replacing the cutters.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure that you use two hands when using a grinder.</li>
    
    <li>The weight of the grinder is enough pressure for proper operation.</li>
    
    <li>Do not wear loose clothing when grinding.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use grinders in the vicinity of flammable materials.</li></ul>

<h3>POWDER-ACTUATED TOOLS</h3>
<p>Powder-actuated tools, also known as direct fastening tools (Figure 11-32), are used in construction to join materials to hard substrates, such as concrete and steel. Each of these tools holds a charge of gunpowder, which is ignited and blows the fastener into place.</p>
    
		<figure data-id="11-32" class="fullWidth">Powder-actuated tools.</figure>

<p>Powder-actuated tools come in either low- or high-velocity types. Low-velocity tools introduce a piston into the chamber. The propellant acts on the piston, which then drives the fastener into the substrate. A powder-actuated tool is considered to be low velocity if the average test velocity of the fastener does not exceed 492 feet per second.</p>

<p>In high-velocity tools, which are now illegal to manufacture and/or sell in the United States, the propellant acts directly on the fastener, very similar to how a firearm works. Although high-velocity tools are now illegal to manufacture and sell, some that were made decades ago are still in use in the shipbuilding and steel industries.</p>

<p>Powder-actuated fasteners are usually nails made of high-quality, hardened steel, although there are many specialized fasteners designed for specific applications in the construction and manufacturing industries. Powder-actuated fastening is a unique and very cost-efficient method used in a variety of construction situations, from home building to large urban structures.</p>

<p>Powder-actuated technology was developed for commercial use during the Second World War, when high-velocity fastening systems were used to temporarily repair damage to ships. In the case of hull breach, these tools are used to fasten a plate of steel over the damaged area.</p>

<h4>Care of Powder-Actuated Tools</h4>
<p>Powder-actuated tools are very dangerous, and it is critically important that they are used properly and safely. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires safety training be completed by all users before they work with powder-actuated tools. A summary of OSHA requirements follows:</p>
    
<ul>
   <li>Test powder-actuated fastening tools each day before loading to ensure that the safety devices are in proper working condition. Immediately remove from service any tool found not to be in proper working order until repairs are made.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use powder-actuated fastening tools shall in an explosive or flammable atmosphere.</li>
    
    <li>Use all tools with the type of shield or muzzle guard appropriate for a particular use.</li>
    
    <li>Do not drive fasteners into very hard or brittle materials, such as cast iron, glazed tile, surface hardened steel, glass block, live rock, face brick, or hollow title.</li>
    
    <li>Do not drive fasteners into soft materials unless such materials are backed by a substance that will prevent the pin or fastener from passing completely through and creating a flying missile hazard on the opposite side.</li>
    
    <li>Unless a special guard, fixture, or jig is used, do not drive fasteners directly into materials such as brick or concrete within 3 inches of the unsupported edge or corner, or into steel surfaces within 1/2 inch of the unsupported edge or corner. When fastening other material, such as 2- by 4-inch lumber to a concrete surface, do not drive fasteners of greater than 7/32-inch shank diameter shall not be used and fasteners within 2 inches of the unsupported edge or corner of the work surface.</li>
    
    <li>Do not drive fasteners through existing holes unless a positive guide is used to secure accurate alignment.</li>
    
    <li>Do not attempt to drive a fastener into a spalled area caused by an unsatisfactory fastening.</li>
    
    <li>Wear personal protective equipment when using powder-actuated fastening tools.</li>
    
    <li>Before using powder-actuated tools, be thoroughly instructed by a competent person in the safe use of such tools as follows:</li>
    <ul>
            <li>Before using a tool, inspect it to determine that it is clean, that all moving parts operate freely, and that the barrel is free from obstructions.</li>
            
            <li>When a tool develops a defect during use, immediately cease to use it and shall notify his or her supervisor.</li>
            
            <li>Do not load tools until just prior to the intended firing time, and do not leave the tool unattended while it is loaded.</li>
            
            <li>Do not point the tool, whether loaded or empty, at any person, and keep hands clear of the open barrel end.</li>
            
            <li>In case of a misfire, hold the tool in the operating position for at least 15 seconds and continue to hold the muzzle against the work surface during disassembly or opening of the tool and removal of the powder load.</li>
            
            <li>Do not leave tools or powder charges unattended in places where they would be available to unauthorized persons.</li>
    </ul></ul>
