<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<h2>PNEUMATIC TOOLS</h2>

<p>Pneumatic and electrical tools are similar except for the method of actuation. Pneumatic tools are driven by gas, usually compressed air supplied by a gas canister or compressor. The amount of pneumatic, or air, pressure required to operate the tool depends on the size of the tool and the type of operation you are performing. Check the manufacturer’s manual for the proper air pressure to operate the tool.</p>

<p>Pneumatic tools can also run on compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in small canisters, which allows for greater portability. Pneumatic tools are generally cheaper and safer to run and maintain than the equivalent electric power tool. Pneumatic tools have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you will learn about different types of pneumatic tools and their uses. You will also learn how to select the right pneumatic tool for the job, use various types of pneumatic tools, and provide the proper care of the pneumatic tools to keep them in good working condition.</p>

<h3>NEEDLE GUN SCALERS</h3>
<figure data-id="12-7" class="">Needle gun scaler</figure>
<p>The needle gun scaler (Figure 12-7) is used to remove rust, scale, and old paint from steel surfaces aboard ship. You must be careful when using the needle gun because it will “chew up” anything in its path. The needle gun scaler does the job with an assembly of needles impacting the surface hundreds of times a minute. The main advantage of this scaler is that it can clean out irregular surfaces. The needles self-adjust to the contour of various surfaces, as illustrated in Figure 12-8. Do not use the needle gun scaler on light-metal surfaces because it will pit the surface with its impacting needles.</p>

<p>Observe the following safety tips when operating needle gun scalers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Operate only those pneumatic tools which you are trained and qualified to use.</li>
    <li>Always wear eye protection when using power nailers and staplers.</li>
    <li>Always wear hearing protection, especially for extended operation.</li>
    <li>Wear hand protection when using needle gun scalers.</li>
    <li>Use only clean, dry, and regulated air to prevent damage to the internal workings of the tool.</li>
    <li>Never allow an air tool to operate at full throttle without a work load on the tool.</li>
    <li>Never start a percussion-type air tool (chippers, breakers, busters, and so on) without securing the tooling in the retainer and placing the tip against the work surface.</li>
    <li>Never operate an air tool without the guards in place.</li>
    <li>Work in a well-ventilated area, and work with approved safety equipment, such as dust masks that are specifically designed to filter out microscopic particles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DRILLS</h3>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h4>Pneumatic Drills</h4>
<figure data-id="12-9" class="">Pneumatic drill</figure>
<p>Pneumatic drills (Figure 12-9) have generally replaced hand tools for drilling holes because they are faster and more accurate. With variable speed controls and special clutch drive chucks, they can also be used as electric screwdrivers. More specialized power-driven screwdrivers are also available, which have greatly increased the efficiency of many fastening operations in construction work.</p>

<h4>Pneumatic Impact Wrench</h4>
<figure data-id="12-10" class="">Pneumatic impact wrench</figure>
<p>The pneumatic impact wrench (Figure 12-10) consists of a pistol-grip handle on a housing, which contains a motor that energizes the driving anvil inside the muzzle of the housing. Attachments are fastened to the driving anvil by snapping them onto the socket retainer. The pneumatic impact wrench with its accompanying equipment is primarily intended for applying and removing nuts, bolts, and screws. It may also be used to drive and remove socket head or self-tapping screws.</p>

<h4>Using Pneumatic Drills</h4>

	</div>
</div>


<p>The following steps describe how to use a power drill properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the proper bit required for the task.</li>
    <li>Fit the chuck key (Figure 12-11) into theside adjusting hole between the jaws and the chuck and turn the key counterclockwise until the chuck opens enough to admit the bit shank.</li>
    <li>Insert the bit in to the chuck jaws and tighten securely by turning the chuck key clockwise. Remove the chuck key and store where the key will not get lost.</li>
    <li>Before drilling, ensure the work is stationary or firmly secured.</li>
    <li>Use a center punch or awl to make a small prick point in the spot where the hole will be made (The prick point will prevent the drill bit from bouncing or slipping away from the spot where the hole is to be drilled).</li>
    <li>Connect the air hose.</li>
    <li>Place the drill bit on the marked spot and depress the trigger switch. Begin drilling (Figure 12- 12), exerting firm but even pressure to keep the bit cutting. Withdraw the bit frequently from the work to clean the chips from the bit flutes and to allow the bit to cool.</li>
    <li>Ease up on the drill pressure as the bit approaches the other side of the work surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>After completing the hole, carefully withdraw the rotating drill bit to prevent binding or breaking and release the trigger switch.</p>

<h4>Care of Drills</h4>
<p>Observe the following safety tips when operating drills:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Operate only those pneumatic tools which you are trained and qualified to use.</li>
    <li>Always wear eye protection when using pneumatic drills.</li>
    <li>Always wear hearing protection, especially for extended operation.</li>
    <li>Always check for damaged or loose hose fittings. Whipping hoses can cause severe injury.</li>
    <li>Wear hand protection when using pneumatic drills.</li>
    <li>Always shut off the air supply, drain the hose of air pressure, and disconnect the tool from the air supply when it is not in use.</li>
    <li>Do not make adjustments or perform maintenance of the tool while it is connected to the air supply.</li>
    <li>Keep hands away from rotating or reciprocating accessories, spindles, or other moving parts.</li>
    <li>Maintain a balanced body position and secure footing when using drills.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SANDERS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h4>Orbital Sander</h4>
<figure data-id="12-13" class="">Orbital sander</figure>
<p>The orbital sander (Figure 12-13) is designed for medium-duty applications, such as sanding, polishing, and finishing on a variety of surfaces, including woods, metals, and fiberglass. The orbital sander has a built-in regulator for speed control during operation.</p>

    <li>Do not wear loose clothing when sanding.</li>
    <li>Do not use sanders in the vicinity of flammable materials.</li>
    <li>Use light pressure on the sander. The weight of the sander is enough to sand the material.</li>
    <li>Always shut off the air supply, drain the hose of air pressure, and disconnect the tool from the air supply when it is not in use.</li>
    <li>Do not make adjustments or perform maintenance of the tool while it is connected to the air supply.</li>
    <li>Keep hands away from rotating or reciprocating accessories, spindles, or other moving parts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GRINDERS</h3>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4> 

<h4>Straight Grinders</h4>
<p>A grinder is a rotary drive tool with an output spindle designed to carry an abrasive device. Two common designs are available: straight and angle. The straight grinder (Figure 12-18) has a handle in line with the motor and spindle. The angle grinder (Figure 12-19) has a handle or handles set at right angles to the motor and spindle axis, which are in line. The angle grinder’s output shaft is usually driven by bevel gears, so the output spindle is at an angle to the motor axis.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<h4>Die Grinders</h4>
<figure data-id="12-20" class="">Die grinder</figure>
<p>A die grinder (Figure 12-20) is a rotary drive tool that uses collets for mounting an abrasive device. An angle die grinder’s output shaft is driven by bevel gears, so the output spindle is at an angle to the motor axis.</p>

<h4>Care of Grinders</h4>
<p>Observe the following safety tips when operating grinders:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Operate only those pneumatic tools which you are trained and qualified to use.</li>
    <li>Always wear approved eye protection.</li>
    <li>Always wear hearing protection, especially for extended operation.</li>
    <li>Wear respiratory protection while using a grinder.</li>
    <li>Wear hand protection when using pneumatic grinders.</li>
    <li>Always check for damaged or loose hose fittings. Whipping hoses can cause severe injury.</li>
    <li>Keep the work area clean and well lighted.</li>
    <li>Do not wear loose clothing when grinding.</li>
    <li>Do not use grinders in the vicinity of flammable materials.</li>
    <li>Always shut off the air supply, drain the hose of air pressure, and disconnect the tool from the air supply when not in use.</li>
    <li>Do not make adjustments or perform maintenance of the tool while connected to the air supply.</li>
    <li>Keep hands away from rotating spindles or other moving parts.</li>
    <li>Maintain a balanced body position and secure footing when using grinders.</li>
    <li>All portable pneumatic grinders must be equipped with a safety lock-off device. A safety lock- off device is any operating control that requires positive action by the operator before the tools can be turned on. The lock-off device must automatically and positively lock the throttle in the OFF position when the throttle is released. Two consecutive operations by the same hand are required, first to disengage the lock-off device and then to turn on the throttle. The lock-off device should be integral with the tool. It should not adversely affect the safety or operating characteristics of the tools, and it should not be easily removable. Devices that do not automatically and positively lock the throttle in the OFF position when the throttle is released, such as a "dead-man control," are not safety lock-off devices.</li>
