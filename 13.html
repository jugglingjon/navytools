<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<h2>TAPS, DIES, AND EXTRACTORS</h2>

<p>Taps and dies are used to cut threads in metal, plastics, or hard rubber. The taps are used for cutting internal threads, and the dies are used to cut external threads.</p>

<p>Extractors are used to remove broken taps or screws that have been broken off inside of the hole or fastener.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you will learn about different types of taps, dies, and extractors and their uses. You will also learn how to select the right tap, die, or extractor for the job, use various types of taps, dies, and extractors, and provide the proper care of the taps, dies, and extractors to keep them in good working condition.</p>

<h3>TAPS</h3>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<figure data-id="13-1" class="">Parts of a tap</figure>
<p>Taps (Figure 13-1) are made of hardened steel and have the following parts: a
square end, a round shank, a body (threaded) section, and a chamfer. The square end is used to turn the tap with either a straight or T-handled tap wrench. The shank is a smooth, rounded section that is immediately behind the threaded section. The body (threaded) section contains four flutes which have threads cut into their upper edges. They have a hollow section near the center to permit metal shavings to fall away from the cutting edges. The chamfer is the non-threaded end of the tap that allows the tap to be positioned squarely in the metal to be threaded without engaging the threads of the tap.</p>

<h4>Taper (Starting) Hand Tap</h4>
<figure data-id="13-2" class="">Taper (starting) hand tap</figure>
<p>The taper (starting) hand tap (Figure 13-2) has a chamfer (nonthreaded) length equal to 7 to 10 threads. The taper lead distributes the cutting force over a large area. The taper hand tap is used to start tapping operations.</p>

<h4>Plug/Pipe Hand Tap</h4>
<figure data-id="13-3" class="">Plug/pipe hand tap</figure>
<p>Plug/pipe taps (Figure 13-3) are used for pipefitting and places where extremely tight fits are necessary. The tap diameter, from end to end of the threaded portion, increases at the rate of 3/4 inch per foot. All the threads on this tap do the cutting, as compared to the taper taps, on which only the non-chamfered portion does the cutting.</p>

<h4>Bottoming Hand Tap</h4>
<figure data-id="13-4" class="">Bottoming hand tap</figure>
<p>Bottoming hand taps (Figure 13-4) are used for threading the bottom of a blind hole. They have a very short chamfer length of only 1 to 1 1/2 threads for this purpose. Use of both the taper and plug taps should precede the use of the bottoming hand tap. This tap is also used when tapping hard materials.</p>

<h4>Staybolt Tap</h4>
<figure data-id="13-5" class="">Staybolt tap</figure>
<p>Staybolt taps (Figure 13-5) are used in boiler, locomotive, and railroad shops for tapping holes in the outer and inner plates or shells of boilers. The staybolt tap has two separate threaded areas. The first is for cutting threads and the second is for guiding the tap into another piece of metal for threading by the cutting threads. The spindle-type staybolt has an adjustable spindle, which changes the distance between the cutting threads and the guide threads.</p>

<h4>Mud Hand Tap (Washout Tap)</h4>
<figure data-id="13-6" class="">Mud hand tap</figure>
<p>The mud or washout tap (Figure 13-6) has six flutes, tapers 1 1/4 inches per foot, and has 12 threads per inch. It is used for cutting Unified or National form threads in mud plug drain holes.</p>

<h3>DIES</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h4>Rethreading Die</h4>
<figure data-id="13-7" class="">Rethreading die</figure>
<p>A rethreading die (Figure 13-7) is used principally for dressing overbruised or rusty threads on screws or bolts. It is available in a variety of sizes for rethreading National Coarse (NC) and National Fine (NF) threads. Square pipe and rethreading dies are usually hexagonal in shape and can be turned with a socket, box, open-end, or any wrench that will fit. Rethreading dies are available in sets of 6, 10, 14, and 28 assorted sizes in a case.</p>

<h4>Two-Piece Collet Die</h4>
<p>Two-piece collet dies (Figure 13-8) are used with a collet cap and collet guide (Figure 13-9). The die halves are placed in the cap slot and are held in place by the guide, which screws into the underside of the cap. The die is adjusted by setscrews at both ends of the interval slot. This type of adjustable die is issued in various sizes to cover the cutting ranges of NC, NF, and special-form threads. Diestocks to hold the dies come in three different sizes.</p>

</div>


<h4>Round Split Adjustable Die</h4>
<figure data-id="13-10" class="">Round split adjustable die</figure>
<p>Round split adjustable dies (Figure 13-10), also called button dies, can be used in either hand diestocks or machine holders. The adjustment in the screw adjusting type is made by a fine-pitch screw, which forces the sides of the die apart or allows them to spring together. The adjustment in the open adjusting type is made by three screws in the holder, one for expanding and two for compressing the dies. A die holder or handle is needed for proper operation of round split adjustable dies.</p>

<h4>Thread Cutter Set</h4>
<figure data-id="13-11" class="">Thread cutter set</figure>
<p>Thread cutter sets (Figure 13-11) are available in many different combinations of taps and dies, together with diestocks, tap wrenches, guides, and necessary screwdrivers and wrenches to loosen and tighten adjusting screws and bolts.</p>

<h4>Using a Hand Tap</h4>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a hand tap properly:</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection when working where flying particles may cause eye injury.</div>

<ol>
    <li>Clamp a steel plate securely in a vise. Drill and ream a hole of the desired size.</li>
    <li>Select a tap and secure it in a tap wrench.</li>
    <li>Apply cutting oil to the tap and the hole.</li>
    <li>Place the point of the tap in the hole (Figure 13-12); rotate a right-handed tap clockwise for right-hand threads or a left-handed tap counterclockwise for left-hand threads.</li>
    <li>Remove the tap wrench and use a square to check the tap for squareness (Figure 13-13). Check at least two different positions on the tap.</li>
    <li>Replace the tap wrench and continue the tapping operation. It is not necessary to apply pressure, as the threads will be pulled through at all times.</li>
    <li>Remove the tap by turning in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li>Wipe the excess oil and metal shavings from the metal plate.</li>
    <li>Check the newly-cut threads with a screw pitch gage before inserting a screw or stud.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using a Die and Diestock</h4>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a die and diestock properly:</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">The work to be threaded must be clean and free of burrs.</div>

<ol>
    <li>Secure the work firmly in a vise.</li>
    <li>Assemble the die and die stock (Figure 13-14).</li>
    <li>Tighten the setscrew.</li>
    <li>Loosen the two thumbscrews to adjust diestock.</li>
    <li>Apply cutting oil to the die and to the work.</li>
    <li>Position the diestock over the work.</li>
    <li>Rotate the diestock clockwise for right-hand threads (Figure 13-15) or rotate a left-handed tap counterclockwise for left-hand threads, slowly but firmly, until the die takes hold.</li>
    <li>After several threads have been cut, use a square to check squareness.</li>
    <li>Turn the diestock one turn forward and one-quarter turn backward. Repeat this procedure until the desired thread length has been cut.</li>
    <li>Carefully back the diestock off the threads by turning in the opposite direction. <li>Clean the threads with a clean rag.</li>
    <li>Check the threads with a screw pitch gage before using.</li>
    <li>Disassemble the die and diestock by loosening the setscrew.</li>
    <li>Wipe clean with a rag.</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-caution">After assembling the die to the diestock, ensure the setscrew is tight. The die can fall out of diestock and become damaged.</div>

<h4>Care of Taps</h4>
<p>Use the following guidelines when working with taps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do NOT attempt to sharpen taps.</li>
    <li>Keep the cutting edges lightly oiled.</li>
    <li>Wipe excess oil and metal shavings from the tap and tap wrench.</li>
    <li>Do NOT throw taps into a drawer or toolbox where they can rub against each other or against other tools. Store them in separate holders, such as in a case, or wrap them individually in cloths to protect the cutting surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Care of Dies</h4>
<p>Use the following guidelines when working with dies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do NOT attempt to sharpen dies.</li>
    <li>Keep the cutting surfaces clean and lightly lubricated.</li>
    <li>Clean the dies with a clean rag after each use.</li>
    <li>Do NOT throw dies into a drawer or toolbox where they can rub against each other or against other tools. Store them in separate holders, such as in a case, or wrap them individually in cloths to protect the cutting surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>EXTRACTORS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h4>Screw Extractor</h4>
<figure data-id="13-16" class="">Screw extractor</figure>
<p>Screw extractors (Figure 13-16) are used to remove broken screws without damaging the surrounding material or the threaded hole.</p>

<p>Screw extractors are straight, with spiraling flutes at one end. These extractors are available in sizes to remove broken screws having 1/4- to 1/2-inch outside diameter (OD). Spiral tapered extractors are sized to remove screws and bolts from 3/16- to 2 1/8-inch OD.</p>

<p>The spiral-tapered type requires a twist drill for drilling a pilot hole.</p>

<h4>Tap Extractor</h4>
<figure data-id="13-17" class="">Tap extractor</figure>
<p>Tap extractors (Figure 13-17) are used to remove broken taps. Tap extractors are sized to remove taps from 3/16- to 2 1/8-inch OD. The tap extractor is usually of the flute type and requires the use of a wrench to turn the tap. It is used for removing taps with no external area. The tap extractor has fingers that enter the flutes of the tap.</p>

<p>Most extractor sets include twist drills and a drill guide.</p>

<h4>Using a Spiral Tapered Screw Extractor</h4>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a spiral tapered screw extractor properly:</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection when working where flying particles may cause eye injury.</div>

<ol>
    <li>Drill a hole in the broken screw (Figure 13-18). Use a drill size guide if available. If one is not available, drill the hole slightly smaller than the diameter of the extractor (when drilling larger screws it may be necessary to drill a small pilot hole first, then a larger hole).</li>
    <li>Insert the extractor in the drilled hole.</li>
    <li>Remove the broken screw by turning the extractor counter clockwise (Figure 13-19). The extractor may be turned using a tap wrench or open end wrench.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Care of Extractors</h4>
<p>Use the following guidelines when working with extractors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the extractor clean and lightly oiled.</li>
    <li>Clean the extractor with a clean rag after each use.</li>
    <li>Use the right size of extractor for the broken screw or bolt you are removing to avoid damaging the extractor or threads of the hole.</li>
    <li>Do not throw extractors into a drawer or toolbox where they can rub against each other or against other tools. Store them in separate holders, such as in a case, or wrap them individually in cloths to protect the cutting surfaces.</li>
