<h4>Care of Pullers</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when working with pullers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use each tool only for its designated purpose.</li>
    <li>Keep the pullers clean at all times.</li>
    <li>DO NOT grease or oil the gripping edges. The grease will cause the tool to slip.</li>
    <li>Clean all the tools after each use and store them so the threads will not become damaged.</li>
    <li>To prevent the attachments and adapters from being separated from the puller, store them together in the proper container or original package.</li>
    <li>Oil the pullers after each use and wipe them clean before using again. Occasionally apply linseed oil to wooden parts of the tools to prevent them from drying out.</li>
    <li>Never use a damaged chain assembly. Replace the damaged chain links promptly.</li>
    <li>Always use the proper size and design of cable jaw grips for each task. Using the wrong size or style can be dangerous.</li>
    <li>Be sure the tackle used with blocks is safe and meets the lifting requirements.</li>
    <li>When using the tension puller, be sure the hook (or hooks) is the correct size to hold the cable snugly.</li>
    <li>When swinging the trip wire grapnel, hold the rotating tool at a safe distance from the arm.</li>
    <li>When storing for long periods, apply a coat of rust preventive compound on the tools and store them in a dry place.</li>
</ul>
