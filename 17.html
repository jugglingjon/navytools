<h3>CHOPPING TOOLS</h3>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h4>Axes</h4>
<p>Axes are cutting tools used for the cutting down of trees and for the chopping and splitting of wood. They may be either single or double-edged. Single-bit, double-bit, and crash axes are the most common types. Sizes of axes vary depending upon their design and purpose.</p>

<h4>Single-Bit Ax</h4>
<figure data-id="17-1" class="">Single-bit ax</figure>
<p>The single-bit ax (Figure 17-1) is used to cut down or prune trees. It can also be used to cut or trim logs and heavy brush, or to split and cut wood. It has a forged, hardened steel head, a ground polished cutting edge, and an elliptical tapered eye for the long, slightly curved handle. The head has a flat face at one end and a cutting edge or “bit” at the other.</p>

<h4>Double-Bit Ax</h4>
<figure data-id="17-2" class="">Double-bit ax</figure>
<p>The double-bit ax (Figure 17-2) is used for the chopping down and the lopping and topping of trees. The double-bit ax has a wedge-type head with two cutting edges.</p>

<h4>Crash Ax</h4>
<figure data-id="17-3" class="">Crash ax</figure>
<p>The crash ax (Figure 17-3), or fireman’s ax, is used by emergency personnel to gain quick access to a given area. This ax has a steel head with a cutting blade or bit at one end, and a spike-like extension at the other.</p>

<h4>Half-Hatchet</h4>
<figure data-id="17-4" class="">Half-hatchet</figure>
<p>The half-hatchet (Figure 17-4), commonly called a hatchet, consists of a forged steel head with a hardened, tempered blade and a hickory handle firmly attached with wedges. The hatchet has an octagonal, flat striking head opposite the blade. A beveled slot in the blade is for removing nails.</p>

<h4>Adz</h4>
<figure data-id="17-5" class="">Adz</figure>
<p>The adz (Figure 17-5) is a chopping tool used for chopping and smoothing lumber or logs where a great deal of wood or bark is to be removed. The adz is a form of ax where the edge of the blade is at a right angle to the handle. It has a curved steel head attached to a curved handle.</p>

<h4>Timber Wedges</h4>
<figure data-id="17-6" class="">Timber wedges</figure>
<p>The timber wedge (Figure 17-6) is used with a sledge, primarily to split logs and timber. When sawing timber or thick lumber, it may also be used to spread the cut so the saw will not bind. The timber wedge is a steel tool resembling a slender single-bit ax head. One end is slightly fan-shaped and sharpened to a dull edge. The other end is flat, where a sledge can strike when driving the wedge into a log.</p>

<h4>Maul</h4>
<figure data-id="17-7" class="">Maul</figure>
<p>The maul (Figure 17-7) features an octagonal face on one end of the head and an ax on the other end. These hardened, heavy striking tools will have a striking face on one end and a striking face or a special purpose striking end on the other.</p>

<h4>Using the Single-Bit Ax</h4>

<div class="alert alert-note">Reverse the position of the hands, feet, and shoulder if left-handed.</div>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a single-bit ax properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, clear the work area of material that might deflect the ax blade. The user’s body weight should be evenly distributed, with knees set, but not tense. The feet should be spread at a comfortable distance to retain balance, while the body should be relaxed and free to swing and bend at the waist.</li>
    <li>To use the ax, grasp the ax handle with both hands close together near the end of the handle, with the right or leading hand closer to the ax head. The left foot should be closer to the work.</li>
    <li>To start the swing, bring the ax back over the right shoulder (Figure 17-8), bending the elbow as the right hand slides up the handle toward the ax head.</li>
    <li>On the downswing, let the right hand slide down the handle, toward the left hand.</li>
    <li>At the end of the downswing, the right hand will be beside the left hand at the end of the handle (Figure 17-9).</li>
</ol>

	</div>
</div>


<h4>Using the Adz</h4>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Always wear suitable eye protection.</div>
<p>The following steps describe how to use an adz properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>To use the adz, first clear the work area of branches and debris.</li>
    <li>Block the timber to be worked on so it cannot slip, slide, or roll.</li>
    <li>Straddle the timber and grip the adz handle with both hands (Figure 17-10). The right hand should be held approximately 12 to 15 inches above the left hand.</li>
    <li>Use short, choppy down strokes (Figure 17-11) while keeping the hands in approximately the same position on the handle. The right hand does not slide toward the left hand as in swinging the ax, because the right hand must be in a position to keep control of the adz head at all times. Sliding the right hand to the end of the handle would allow the adz blade face to be deflected toward the user.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-note">As wood chips accumulate on the work surface, clear them away to prevent deflection of the adz blade.
Reverse the position of the hands if left-handed.</div>

<h4>Using the Timber Wedge</h4>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Always wear suitable eye protection.</div>
<div class="alert alert-caution">Do not use a timber wedge that has nicks or burrs, since the rough sections can scratch the hands or can cause chips to break off when struck by sledge.</div>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a timber wedge properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>To use the timber wedge, first block the log to be split, or steady it so it cannot roll.</li>
    <li>With the left hand, hold the wedge’s narrow edge on the log where a split is desired.</li>
    <li>Hold the sledge handle in the right hand, close to its head, and start driving the wedge into the log with a pounding action (Figure 17-12).</li>
    <li>Give the wedge a few blows, then start a second wedge on the line farther along the log and drive it with a few sledge blows.</li>
    <li>Alternate driving the wedges (Figure 17-13) into the log until log splits. For longer logs, more than two wedges should be used.</li>
</ol>    
<div class="alert alert-note">Reverse the position of the hands if left-handed.</div>

<h4>Care of Chopping Tools</h4>
<p>Use the following guidelines when working with chopping tools:</p>
<ul>        
    <li>Always wear eye protection when working where flying particles may injure the eyes.</li>
    <li>Keep arms, legs, and feet out of path of ax.</li>
    <li>Before swinging a tool, be sure no one is close enough to be injured.</li>
    <li>Never use any tool that is defective.</li>
    <li>Do not use dull or defective tools.</li>
    <li>Do not use a tool not designed for the job. It can be dangerous.</li>
    <li>Before using an ax, clean the work area of material that might deflect the ax blade.</li>
    <li>Clean all chopping tools after use.</li>
    <li>Store tools to protect the heads and cutting edges.</li>
    <li>For prolonged storage, keep the tools free of rust by wiping with oil.</li>
    <li>In very cold weather, never use a chopping tool before the blade is warm. A cold blade is brittle and will break easily.</li>
    <li>Promptly replace the wooden handles on all chopping tools when needed. When changing the handle, apply a light coating of linseed oil.</li>
</ul>    
<div class="alert alert-warning">Linseed oil is a flammable liquid. To avoid personal injury, properly dispose of all cleaning rags in non-combustible containers.</div>
