<h3>JACKS</h3>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h4>Screw Jacks</h4>
<figure data-id="22-1" class="">Vertical bell base screw jack</figure>
<p>Vertical screw jacks come in several capacities and different lowered and raised heights. The screw moves up or down, depending on the direction the handle is turned. These jacks are used for many different purposes.</p>

<p>Screw jacks can be used to lift vehicles. They can also be used to raise heavy crates, small buildings, or other items too heavy to be raised by prying with wrecking bars.</p>

<p>The vertical bell base screw jack (Figure 22-1) is operated by hand using a steel bar handle which is inserted in the holes of the top housing or head.</p>

<figure data-id="22-2" class="">Vertical screw jack with collapsible handle</figure>
<p>The vertical screw jack with collapsible handle (Figure 22-2) is operated by hand using the collapsible handle which is inserted into a socket.</p>

<figure data-id="22-3" class="">Outrigger jack</figure>
<p>Another type of screw jack is called an outrigger jack (Figure 22-3). The outrigger jack is equipped with end fittings which permit pulling parts together or pushing them apart.</p>

<h4>Ratchet Lever Jacks</h4>
<figure data-id="22-4" class="">Vertical ratchet lever jack</figure>
<p>A vertical ratchet lever jack (Figure 22-4) has a rack bar that is raised or lowered through a ratchet lever. Some vertical ratchet lever jacks are equipped with a double socket. One of the sockets is used to lower the jack, while the other is used to raise the jack. Other vertical ratchet lever jacks are built with one socket and an automatic lowering feature.</p>

<p>An outrigger ratchet jack is ratchet-operated and has an extra reverse ratchet handle and a base plate.</p>

<h4>Hydraulic Jacks</h4>
<p>Hydraulic jacks (Figure 22-5) operate by applying pressure to one side of a hydraulic cylinder which in turn moves the jack head. Hydraulic jacks are lowered automatically by releasing the pressure on the cylinder. Vertical hydraulic jacks come in a variety of types, in capacities from 3 to 100 tons, and have different extended heights.</p>

<p>A push-pull hydraulic jack, also referred to as a porta power jack (Figure 22-6), consists of a pump and ram connected by a hydraulic or oil hose. These jacks are rated at 3-, 7-, 20-, 30-, and 100-ton capacities and have many different applications.</p>

<p>The push-pull hydraulic jacks are furnished with an assortment of attachments that enable pushing, pulling, lifting, pressing, bending, spreading, and clamping operations. The pump is hand operated. The control valve on the side of the pump is simply turned clockwise, while the hand lever is stroked up and down to extend the ram. The flexible hydraulic or oil hose allows the user to operate the ram from a safe distance and in any desired position.</p>

<p>The ram retracts automatically by turning the control valve counterclockwise. The attachments can be threaded to the end of the plunger to the ram body or into the ram base.</p>

<p>Airframe jacks (Figure 22-7) are used for lifting an entire aircraft off the ground or deck. Airframe jacks are commonly called tripod jacks. The jacks may also be called wing, nose, fuselage, and tail jacks. These names come from the jack placement on the aircraft.</p>

<p>There are two different types of tripod jacksâ€”fixed height and variable height. Both are mobile, self-contained, hydraulically operated units. They consist of three basic assemblies; the hydraulic cylinder, the tubular steel wheel tripod leg structure, and the hydraulic pump.</p>

<p>Service or shop jacks (Figure 22-8) are used for lifting heavy vehicles for maintenance or repairs. Each jack is rated for different loads ranging from 2 to 20 tons. The long handle is used to pump the hydraulic cylinder to lift the lifting arm and saddle. Wheels and casters allow the jack to move to compensate for the lifting arc.</p>

<h4>Using a Vertical Screw Jack</h4>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a vertical screw jack properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify the lifting location on the item.</li>
    <li>Place the jack on a solid surface.</li>
    <li>Insert the handle (Figure 22-9) in the appropriate location and turn the handle to raise the jack (Figure 22-10). Typically, the handle is turned clockwise to raise the jack and counterclockwise to lower.</li>
    <li>The jack will raise the load with every degree of hand turn.</li>
    <li>Insert blocks or jack stands to support the load to remove the jack.</li>
    <li>Screw the jack all the way down in the lower housing and withdraw the handle or bar for storage upon completion of the job.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using a Hydraulic Jack</h4>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a hydraulic jack properly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The operator should become familiar with the jack, its capabilities, and its operations.</li>
    <li>Identify the lifting location on the item and position the jack (Figure 22-11).</li>
    <li>Place the jack on a solid surface.</li>
    <li>To raise a load, pump the handle of the jack (Figure 22-12) using smooth, full strokes.</li>
    <li>Insert blocks or jack stands to support the load to remove the jack.</li>
    <li>To lower a load, slowly turn the handle counterclockwise to lower the load to the ground.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Care of Jacks</h4>
<p>Use the following guidelines when working with jacks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep fingers away from all moving parts.</li>
    <li>Be aware of the capabilities of the jack, especially its load capacity.</li>
    <li>Overloading can be hazardous to the jack, the operating personnel, and the load in event of jack failure.</li>
    <li>Inspect all jacks prior to use.</li>
    <li>Coat all surfaces with a thin film of light oil when not in use. When storing for long periods, apply a rust-preventive compound and store in a dry place.</li>
    <li>Make certain that hydraulic jacks are filled with oil and that there are no visible oil leaks before use.</li>
    <li>Periodically check the hydraulic fluid level in hydraulic jacks. Make sure the ram is in the retracted position when checking the level of oil and when filling.</li>
    <li>Ratchet lever jacks should be well greased. A thin coat applied by hand or a brush is sufficient for all movable parts except the bushings. The bushings should be filled with grease in the small hole provided for greasing purposes. Keep rack sides and front greased, but do not grease the rack teeth.</li>
    <li>When jacking up vehicles, make certain no one is under the vehicle to be raised. Set the hand brake firmly and block the front wheels if a rear wheel is being changed. Block the rear wheels if a front wheel is being changed. Place blocking or other supports under the vehicle when it is raised to the desired height to prevent it from dropping if the jack fails.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Never get under a load that is only supported by a jack. All jacks are subject to failure and personal injury could result.</div>
