<h3>PLIERS</h3>
<p>Pliers (Figure 5-1) are a special type of adjustable wrench that are scissor-shaped tools with jaws. The jaws usually have teeth to help grip objects and are adjustable because the two handles move on a pivot. Pliers are made of hardened steel and come with different head styles that determine their use. Pliers are used to hold, cut, and bend wire and soft metals.
</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h5>Slip-Joint Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-1" class="">Parts of a pliers.</figure>
<p>The slip-joint combination pliers (Figure 5-1) have serrated (grooved) jaws, a rod-gripping section, a cutting edge, and a pivot. The serrated jaws and rod-gripping section are used to hold objects. The cutting edge permits the cutting of soft wire and nails. However, cutting hard materials or large-gauge wire will spring the jaws, making the pliers useless. The pivot is used to adjust the jaw opening to handle large or small objects.</p>

<h5>Diagonal Cutting Pliers</h5>
   <figure data-id="5-2" class="">Diagonal cutting pliers.</figure>
    <p>The diagonal cutting pliers (Figure 5-2) have a fixed pivot. The jaws are offset by about 15 degrees and are shaped to give enough knuckle clearance while making flush cuts. The diagonal cutting pliers are used for cutting small, light materials, such as wire, cotter pins, and similar materials. These pliers are not to be used to hold or grip objects.</p>

<h5>Lineman’s Pliers</h5>

<p>The lineman’s pliers (Figure 5-3) have serrated jaws, a rod-gripping section, side cutters, a wire cropper, a fixed pivot, and parallel handles. The flat, serrated jaws are
    used to bend sheet metal and twist electrical wire. The rod- gripping section is used to hold rods and bend small rods. The side cutters are located just above the pivot point, where maximum pressure may be applied.</p>
    
<figure data-id="5-3" class="">Lineman’s pliers.</figure>

<p>They are ground at an angle, permitting sharp flush cuts on electrical wire. A pair of croppers is located above the
    pivot. They are used to shear larger wire. Lineman’s pliers used around electrical circuits have insulated sleeves over the handles to reduce the possibility of electrical shock.</p>

<h5>Parallel Jaw Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-4" class="">Parallel jaw pliers.</figure>
<p>The parallel jaw pliers (Figure 5-4) are constructed so that the jaws remain parallel to each other throughout the entire distance of travel. They have two jaws two jaws, a pivot pin, curved handles, and tension springs. The tension springs are contained within the curved handles and will open the jaws when the handles are released. These pliers are used to grip objects that have flat surfaces.</p>

<h5>Long Nose Pliers (Needle Nose Pliers)</h5>
<figure data-id="5-5" class="">Long nose (needle nose) pliers.</figure>
<p>Long nose pliers, also known as needle nose pliers, are shown in Figure 5-5. The pointed nose makes them useful for work in tight places where other pliers cannot reach. The jaws and cutting blades meet evenly.</p>

<h5>Flat Nose Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-6" class="">Flat nose pliers.</figure>
<p>The flat nose pliers (Figure 5-6) have flat serrated jaws, a fixed pivot, and curved handles that may have insulated sleeves. These pliers are used to bend light sheet metal and wire.</p>

<h5>Round Nose Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-7" class="">Round nose pliers.</figure>
<p>The round nose pliers (Figure 5-7) are used to make loops in soft wire. It has jaws that are smooth and round, a fixed pivot, and curved handles, which may have insulated sleeves.</p>

<!-- Page 3 -->

<h5>Straight-Lip Flat-Jaw Tongs</h5>
<figure data-id="5-8" class="">Straight-lip flat-jaw tongs.</figure>
<p>The straight-lip flat-jaw tongs (Figure 5-8) have two straight jaws, a fixed pivot point, and long, straight handles. These tongs are used to hold bearings and bearing inserts while they are set in place.</p>

<h5>End Cutting Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-9" class="">End cutting pliers.</figure>
<p>The end cutting pliers (Figure 5-9) are used to cut wire flush to the working surface. They are designed to keep hands and fingers safely away from the wire ends.</p>

<h5>Wire Strippers (Multipurpose)</h5>
<figure data-id="5-10" class="">Wire strippers (multipurpose).</figure>
<p>Wire strippers (Figure 5-10) are used to strip insulation from electrical cord. When closed around wire, only the insulation is cut. The wire core remains undamaged.</p>

<h5>Vise Grip (Locking) Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-11" class="">Vise grip (locking) pliers.</figure>
<p>A vise grip (Figure 5-11) is a type of locking pliers. One side of the handle has an adjusting screw used to set the size of the jaws. Some models also include a lever on the opposite side of the bolt to unlock the pliers by pushing the handles apart.</p>

<h5>Tongue and Groove (Channel Lock) Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-12" class="">Tongue and groove (channel lock) pliers.</figure>
<p>Tongue and groove pliers, also known as channel lock pliers, are shown in Figure 5-12. They have multiple size adjustments that make them good for gripping and applying limited torque to round, square, flat, and hexagonal objects. Their jaws may be straight, smooth, or curved. They are used mostly in plumbing and electrical.</p>

<h5>Wire-Twister Pliers or Safety Wire Pliers</h5>

 <figure data-id="5-13" class="">Wire-twister or safety wire pliers.</figure>

 <figure data-id="5-14" class="fullWidth">Safety wire methods.</figure>

<p>Wire-twister pliers or safety wire pliers (Figure 5-13) are three-way pliers: they hold, twist, and cut. Safety wiring is the most positive and satisfactory method of safety tying. It  is a method of wiring two or more units. The tendency of one unit to loosen is counteracted by the tightening of the wire.

<!-- Page 4 -->

To operate, grasp the wire between the two diagonal jaws, and the thumb will bring the locking sleeve into place. A pull on the knob twirls the twister, making uniform twists in the wire. The spiral rod may be pushed back into the twister without unlocking it, and another pull on the knob will give a tighter twist to the wire. A squeeze on the handle unlocks the twister, and the wire can be cut to the desired length with the side cutter. The spiral of the twister should be lubricated occasionally. Examples of safety wiring nuts, bolts, and screws are illustrated in Figure 5-14. The Examples 1, 2, and 5 illustrate the proper method of safety wiring bolts, screws, square head plugs, and similar parts that are wired in pairs. In Examples 6 and 7, a single-threaded component wired to a housing or lug is shown. In Example 3, several components are wired in series. The proper method of wiring castellated nuts and studs is shown in Example 4. Note that there is no loop around the nut.</p>

<h3>HAMMERS</h3>
<p>A hammer is a tool used to deliver an impact to an object. Hammers are mostly used to drive nails, fit parts, or break up objects. There are many types of hammers designed for specific uses, which vary in shape and structure. Most hammers include a handle and a head, with most of the weight in the head. The strongest, safest hammers have heads made of tough alloy (two or more metals) or drop-forged steel. The two main types of hammers are claw and ball peen.</p>

 
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Claw Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-23" class="">Parts of a claw hammer.</figure>
<p>The parts of a claw hammer are shown in Figure 5-23. Use the flat head to drive nails, wedges, and dowels. Use the two-pronged claw to remove nails from wood.</p>
<h5>Bell-faced Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-24" class="">Bell-faced hammer.</figure>
<p>The bell-faced hammer (Figure 5-24) has a slightly rounded (convex) face. It takes some practice to become skilled with this hammer, but it can help you drive a nail head flush to the wood without marring the surface of the wood.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<h5>Framing Hammer</h5>
<p>The framing hammer (Figure 5-26) is a claw hammer with an oversized head used in framing carpentry. The larger, heavier head improves the user's accuracy and decreases the number of blows required to fully drive the nail into the wood. This hammer may leave slight indentations in the surface of the wood, but that is not important in rough carpentry. The claw on a framing hammer is straighter than on a regular claw hammer; it is used to pry apart nailed boards.Framing hammers often have a milled or waffle face, as shown in Figure 5-27, which helps prevent the hammer from slipping off the nail head if the nail is not struck precisely.</p>

<h5>Ball Peen Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-28" class="">Parts of a ball peen hammer.</figure>
<p>The parts of a ball peen hammer are shown in Figure 5-28. A ball peen hammer is used on metal for tasks, such as riveting, center punching, and bending or</p>
<p>shaping soft metal. The head of this hammer is soft and will dent if used to pound nails.</p>

<h3>SCREWDRIVERS</h3>
 <figure data-id="5-60" class="">Parts of a screwdriver.</figure>
<p>A screwdriver (Figure 5-60) is a device used to insert and tighten screws or to loosen and remove screws. A screwdriver has a head or tip that connects with a screw, a mechanism to apply torque by rotating that tip, and a way to position and support the screwdriver. A typical manual screwdriver is made up of a roughly cylindrical handle, with a shaft fixed to the handle, including a tip shaped to fit a particular type of screw. The handle and shaft support and position the screwdriver, and apply torque when rotated. The blade is made of tempered steel so it will resist wear, bending, and breaking.</p>
<p>There are many different types of screwdrivers, identified by the type of screws they fit. Some of the more common types of screwdrivers are flat head, Phillips® head, clutch drive, TORX, Robertson, and Allen (hex).</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
 <figure data-id="5-61" class="">Flat (slot) head screwdriver.</figure>
<h5>Flat (Slot) Head Screwdriver</h5>
<p>The flat head screwdriver (Figure 5-61) is used to drive and remove standard slotted screws. It can have a round or square shank and ranges in size from 1/6 to 1/4 inch. The tip of this screwdriver is flared at the shoulder of the blade so that it is wider than the driver bar.</p>

<!-- Page 17 -->

<h5>Phillips® Head Screwdriver</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-62" class="">Phillips® head screwdriver.</figure>
<p>The Phillips® head screwdriver (Figure 5-62) is used to tighten and loosen Phillips® head screws. It is the most common type of crosshead screwdriver and ranges in size from 0 to 4, 0 being the smallest.</p>

<h5>Clutch Drive Screwdriver</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-63" class="">Clutch drive screwdriver.</figure>
<p>The clutch drive screwdriver (Figure 5-63) is used to tighten and loosen clutch head screws, which are shaped like an hourglass. The clutch drive screw has extra holding power, especially for use in cars and appliances.</p>

<h5>Offset Screwdrivers</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-64" class="">Offset screwdriver.</figure>
<p>Offset screwdrivers (Figure 5-64) are used to drive or remove screws that cannot be lined up straight with common screwdrivers, or that are located in tight corners. Some offset screwdrivers are made with two blades, one of a different size at each end. Others are ratchet-type offset, which are reversible for working in tight spots and allow the screw to be driven without having to remove the tip from the screw head. A double-tip offset screwdriver has four blades.</p>

<h5>TORX Screwdriver</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-65" class="">TORX screwdriver.</figure>
<p>The TORX screwdriver (Figure 5-65) is used to tighten and loosen six-point star head screws. TORX head screws are used in cars, appliances, and lawn and garden equipment.</p>

<h5>Ratchet Screwdrivers</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-66" class="">Ratchet screwdriver.</figure>
 <figure data-id="5-67" class="">Spiral ratchet screwdriver.</figure>

<p>Ratchet screwdrivers (Figure 5-66) are used to drive or remove small screws rapidly. The spiral ratchet screwdriver automatically drives or removes screws. It can be adjusted to turn left or right, or can be locked to act as a common screwdriver. Some spiral ratchets have a spring in the handle that automatically returns the handle for the next stroke. Another style of ratchet screwdriver has a knurled collar for rotating the blade with your fingers. The spiral type (Figure 5-67) has separate blades that are inserted in the chuck. The common ratchet screwdriver has one integral blade.</p>

<h5>Screwdriver Bits</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-68" class="">Screwdriver bit set.</figure>
<p>A screwdriver bit (Figure 5-68) is a screwdriver blade with a square, hex, or notched shank so that it can be used with other tools.</p>

<h5>Jeweler’s Screwdrivers</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-69" class="">Jeweler’s screwdrivers.</figure>
<p>Jeweler’s screwdrivers (Figure 5-69) are made for driving and removing small screws. They usually have knurled handles and a swivel-end finger rest plate.</p>
<p>The tips range from 0.025 to 0.1406 inch wide. Some jeweler’s screwdrivers have removable blades.</p>

<h5>Flexible Screwdrivers</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-70" class="">Flexible screwdriver.</figure>
<p>A flexible screwdriver (Figure 5-70) has a spring steel blade that bends, allowing the user to get around flanges, shoulders, and other parts to drive and remove screws.</p>

<h5>Radio and Pocket Screwdrivers</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-71" class="">Radio screwdriver.</figure>
<p>A radio screwdriver (Figure 5-71) has a round blade that is 1 1/2 inches long. Its use is restricted to very small screws generally used in the construction of radio chassis. The pocket screwdriver is also small, with a square blade that is 1 3/4 inches long. Both screwdrivers have pocket clips.</p>

<!-- Page 18 --> 

<h5>Screw Starter or Gimlet</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-72" class="">Screw starter.</figure>
<p>A screw starter or gimlet (Figure 5-72) has a threaded tip. It is used to make a pilot hole in wood for wood screws.</p>

<h5>Robertson Screwdriver</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-73" class="">Robertson screwdriver.</figure>

<p>The Robertson screwdriver (Figure 5-73) has a square drive that yields high torque power. It is useful to reach screws sunk below the surface of the material.</p>

<h5>Allen (Hex) Screwdriver</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-74" class="">Allen (hex) screwdriver.</figure>

<p>The Allen (hex) screwdriver set (Figure 5-74) contains several sizes that are attached to and fold into a metal carrying case. It is also known as a hex key or hex wrench and is used on screws with hexagonal slots. It is useful for recessed socket head screws.</p>

<h5>Using a Screwdriver</h5>
<p>Use a screwdriver correctly so you do not damage the screwdriver or strip the screw head. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>

<h4>Care of Screwdrivers</h4>
<p>When using a screwdriver, you must follow many guidelines for your own safety and that of others, as well as for maintaining your tool. Use the following guidelines when working with screwdrivers:</p>

<ul>Always use eye protection.
     
<li>Visually inspect your screwdriver before using it. When a screwdriver becomes nicked, when its edges become rounded, or when other damage occurs so that it does not fit a screw slot, it can be reground or filed. The sides must be parallel to keep the tool from lifting from the screw slot, and the tip must be square, at right angles to the sides and to the blade.</li>
     
<li>The plastic handles on screwdrivers should be fire and heat resistant.
         </li>     
     <!-- page 20 -->
     <li>Do not expose a screwdriver to excessive heat because it may reduce the hardness of the blade.</li>
     
     <li>Replace a screwdriver that has a worn or damaged handle or rounded tip.</li>
     
     <li>Keep the screwdriver free of dirt, grease, and grit so the blade will not slip out of the screw head slot. After use, wipe the screwdriver clean and place it in a rack or tool box. For long-term storage, apply rust-preventive compound to all metal surfaces and store it in a dry place.</li>
     
     <li>Screwdrivers used in the shop are best stored in a rack. By storing screwdrivers in a rack, the proper selection of the right screwdriver can be quickly made and fewer injuries will result.</li>
     
     <li>Use the right size of screwdriver for the screw you are driving to avoid having the screwdriver slip. Using the wrong size can also damage the screwdriver or the screw head.</li>
     
     <li>File the blade tip to restore a worn straightedge.</li>
     
     <li>Place the material with which you are working on a work surface and secure it with a clamp or vise.</li>
     
    <li> When you are starting the screw, it is easy to hurt your fingers if the blade slips. Work with caution.</li>
     
    <li> Use screwdrivers for the appropriate purpose and in the correct way. Avoid the following actions:</li>
     <ul>
         
   <li> Using the screwdriver as a punch, chisel, or pry bar.</li>

    <li>Using a screwdriver to score or scrape.</li>

    <li>Using the screwdriver near live wires or as an electrical tester.</li>
     
     <li>Pointing the screwdriver blade toward yourself or anyone else. </li>
     
    <li> Carrying a screwdriver in your pocket.</li>

    <li>Using pliers for added turning leverage on the shank of a screwdriver (A wrench may be used on square-shank screwdrivers).</li>
     </ul>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>WRENCHES</h3>
<p>A wrench is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage when torque is applied to hold and turn bolts, nuts, screws, and pipes. Wrenches are forged from steel alloy to prevent breakage. Wrenches are divided into two categories: nonadjustable and adjustable. Nonadjustable wrenches are made to work on a particular size of bolt, nut, screw, or pipe. Adjustable wrenches are made to tighten or loosen a particular size of bolt, nut, screw, or pipe.</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
 <figure data-id="5-77" class="">Open-end wrench.</figure>
 
<h5>Open-End Wrench</h5>
<p>All open-end wrenches have open jaws on one or both ends of the wrench. Most jaw openings are offset from the shank portion of the wrench by 15 degrees. The wrench length is determined by the size of the jaw opening.
    The open-end wrench (Figure 5-77) grips on two sides of the nut or bolt head, with an opening that can access fasteners that a closed, or box, wrench might not reach. It has openings of different sizes on each end. The opening should fit the nut or bolt exactly to prevent mutilating the edges of the fastener. They can come in sets.

<!-- Page 21 -->
 <figure data-id="5-78" class="">Engineer’s wrench.</figure>

The engineer’s single open-end wrench (Figure 5-
78) has a long, smooth shank providing the user with a better gripping surface. It is used to reach behind or below blind surfaces.</p>

<p>The engineer’s double open-end wrench has openings of different sizes on each end. This type of an arrangement permits a smaller number of wrenches to complete a set. The engineer’s double open-end wrench is also used to reach behind or below blind surfaces.</p>
  <figure data-id="5-79" class="">Construction wrench.</figure>

<p>The construction wrench (Figure 5-79) combines the open-end jaw with a long, tapered shank providing a wrench/alignment punch combination. The construction wrench is used in the building trades and on heavy objects that require alignment before fastening.</p>
   <figure data-id="5-80" class="">S-shape wrench.</figure>

<p>The S-Shape wrench (Figure 5-80) has a 22 1/2-degree offset. It is used to reach around obstructing objects.</p>

<p>Ignition wrenches (Figure 5-81) have the same-size jaw opening on both ends. However, one end of the wrench is offset by 15 degrees, and the other end is offset by 60 degrees. Ignition wrenches are smaller in size because they are used to remove components of automotive ignition systems.</p>
   <figure data-id="5-81" class="">Ignition wrench.</figure>
   <figure data-id="5-82" class="">Box end wrench.</figure>
   <figure data-id="5-83" class="">Half-moon wrench.</figure>

<h5>Box End Wrench</h5>
<p>A box end wrench (Figure 5-82) surrounds the nut, bolt head, or stud on all sides. It is available with both 6- and 12-point openings. The 12-point opening is more common because it may be used on both square and hexagonal bolt heads. Some models have ratcheting capability. Box wrench openings are offset from the shank by 15 degrees to give more room for your knuckles or to give clearance over obstructions. A box wrench should be used whenever possible because it provides the best protection to both the user and the equipment. The major disadvantage of the box wrench is that enough clearance must be above and around the bolt head to place the wrench
    over the bolt head. The length of the box wrench depends upon the size of the opening.</p>
       <figure data-id="5-84" class="">Split-box end wrench.</figure>

<p>The half-moon wrench (Figure 5-83) has different-size openings at each end and has a curved shank. The half-moon wrench is used when it is necessary to reach around objects in tight spaces.</p>

<!-- Page 22 -->

<p>The split-box wrench (Figure 5-84) is a 12-point wrench with 2 points cut away. The split-box wrench is used on pipe unions or couplings where you want the protection of a box wrench, but need to slide the wrench around a pipe.</p>
       <figure data-id="5-85" class="">Structural-tapered handle wrench.</figure>

<p>The structural-tapered handle wrench (Figure 5-
    85)	combines a box wrench opening with a tapered shank to produce a box wrench/alignment pin combination. It is usually used on heavy structural construction (bridge girders, building beams, etc.).</p>
       <figure data-id="5-86" class="">Ratchet-box end wrench.</figure>

<p>Ratchet-box end wrenches (Figure 5-86) are either reversible or nonreversible. The ratchet-box end wrench does not have to be lifted up and repositioned each time the shank has reached its maximum travel between two obstructions. The ratchet-box wrench provides an easy means of removing and/or installing nuts or bolts that are not under strain. These wrenches should not be used to torque down or to free nuts or bolts.
    </p>
    
       <figure data-id="5-87" class="">Combination wrench.</figure>
    
<h5>Combination Wrench</h5>
<p>The combination wrench (Figure 5-87) has a box wrench and an open-end wrench on opposite sides of the same tool. The two ends are usually the same size.</p>

<h5>Allen Wrench</h5>
       <figure data-id="5-88" class="">Allen wrench.</figure>

<p>The Allen wrench (Figure 5-88) is also known as a hex key wrench. It is a short, L-shaped tool designed to turn bolts or screws with hexagonal heads. Allen wrenches usually come in sets of different-size wrenches.</p>

<h5>Pipe Wrenches</h5>
       <figure data-id="5-89" class="">Pipe wrench.</figure>

<p>There are four basic types of pipe wrenches: the stillson wrench, the spud wrench, the strap wrench, and the chain wrench. They are all used to connect or break pipe joints or to turn cylindrical parts.
    The pipe wrench (Figure 5-89) is also known as a stillson wrench. It has jaws that bite into the surface of pipe to hold it for turning, and should not be used on plated pipes because it can mar the surface. It is
    used to screw pipes into elbows or other threaded items.</p>

<!-- Page 21 -->
       <figure data-id="5-90" class="">Spud wrench.</figure>

<p>The spud wrench (Figure 5-90) is meant to work on a piece of piping found on older toilets and sinks, which is called a “spud”. This wrench is used to tighten and loosen the collar, bolts, and other hardware holding the spud to the toilet or sink. The narrow jaws of the spud wrench are useful in tight spaces.
    </p>
 
        <figure data-id="5-91" class="">Strap pipe wrench.</figure>

<p>Strap pipe wrenches (Figure 5-91) have a leather or canvas strap that is attached to the handle. The strap is looped around the pipe and back through the handle to grip the pipe. The strap pipe wrench will not scratch the surface of the pipe.</p>
 
        <figure data-id="5-92" class="">Chain pipe wrench.</figure>

<p>Chain pipe wrenches (Figure 5-92) have a section of bicycle-type chain permanently attached to the handle. The upper section of the head has teeth that mate with the links of the chain. The chain is wrapped around the pipe and pulled over the head section of the wrench to grip the pipe. Chain pipe wrenches will scratch the surface of the pipe.</p>
 
<h5>Adjustable Wrench</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-93" class="">Adjustable wrench.</figure>

<p>The adjustable wrench (Figure 5-93) has an adjustable end opening that comes in locking and nonlocking styles. The locking style can secure the jaws in the desired position, so when properly adjusted, it will not slip. The nonlocking style requires frequent readjustment and is prone to slipping. The adjustable wrench is used to tighten or loosen nuts and bolts, but never on a fastener that has been rounded off. Make sure the movable jaw is located on the side where the rotation will be done.</p>

<h5>Socket Wrenches</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-94" class="">Sockets.</figure>

<p>The socket wrench (Figure 5-94) consists of a round metal sleeve with a square opening in one end for insertion of a handle, and a 6- or 12-point wrench opening in the other. They are available in both common (short) and deep (long) lengths. The length of the socket does not determine its size. Socket wrenches usually come in sets. The square or drive end may vary in size from 1/4 to 1 inch. In socket sets, the drive end determines the size; for example, a 1/4-inch drive set may contain nine sockets ranging in size from 3/16 through 1/2 inch. In 3/8-inch drive, the smallest socket would be 3/8 inch. This overlap in size allows better control by the user and prevents breakage of either
    
    <!-- Page 22 -->
    
    the socket or the equipment from using the wrong-size handle. A universal joint socket and spark plug socket are examples of specially designed sockets. The universal joint socket is used when it is necessary to reach around an object. The spark plug socket has a rubber insert. This insert protects the ceramic insulator during removal and/or installation of the spark plug. All sockets must be used with some type of handle. Sockets are used to remove and/or install common-size nuts or bolts.</p>


<h5>Socket Wrench Handles, Extensions, and Adapters</h5>
<p>Ratchet handles (Figure 5-95) may have either a straight head or a flex head. Both types have a selection lever on the top of the head to determine the direction of drive. The flex head is used to go around objects. Both types are used with socket wrenches for rapid removal of nuts or bolts.</p>

<p>The speed handle (Figure 5-95) has a brace-type shaft with a revolving grip on the top. It is used for rapid removal and/or installation of nuts or bolts, which are out in the open and have little or no torque.</p>
 
<p>A hinged handle (Figure 5-95) has a hinged adapter on one end that may be rotated in 90-degree steps. The hinged handle is used when additional leverage or torque is needed to loosen nuts or bolts.</p>

<p>The socket wrench adapter (Figure 5-95) is used to change the drive size between the socket and the handle. It usually increases or decreases the fractional size by one (1/4 to 3/8 inch). The socket wrench adapter is used to increase or decrease the drive end of a particular handle, allowing it to be used with two different socket sets.</p>

<p>Extensions (Figure 5-95) are either rigid or flexible. They range from 2 to 17 inches in length. Extensions may be used with any socket handle combination to gain clearance above nut or bolt.</p>

        <figure data-id="5-103" class="">Cam-operated- type stud remover.</figure>
<p>Stud removers may be either the cam-operated type or the wedge type. They are used to remove studs from their seats for replacement. A single stud
    remover can be adjusted to remove different-size studs.</p>

<p>The cam-operated type (Figure 5-103) uses a concentric cam to get a grip on the stud. The cam is tightened on the stud through mechanical linkage between the drive shank and the cam.</p>

<p>Wedge-type stud removers (Figure 5-104) are made of a socket housing and two metal wedges. The socket is placed over the stud to be removed and the wedges are driven into the socket to hold the stud. The socket housing is now turned with a handle to remove the stud.</p>

<h5>Crowfoot Wrench</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-104" class="">Wedge-type stud remover.</figure>
<p>The crowfoot wrench (Figure 5-105) is an open-end wrench head that is turned with a socket handle. It is used to remove and/or install nuts or bolts. It is also used where an obstruction can prevent the use of a regular socket.</p>

<h5>Plug Wrenches</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-105" class="">Crowfoot wrench.</figure>

<p>There are three basic types of plug wrenches: the bar-type, the multiple plug wrench, and the socket-type. Plug wrenches are used to remove and/or install drain plugs.</p>
        <figure data-id="5-106" class="">Bar-type plug wrench.</figure>

<p>Bar-type plug wrenches (Figure 5-106) may be either square or hexagonal and are about 2 inches long. A combination wrench or socket must be used to turn the plug.</p>

   <!--page 25-->
        <figure data-id="5-107" class="">Multiple plug wrench.</figure>
        <figure data-id="5-108" class="">Socket-type plug wrench.</figure>

<p>The multiple plug wrench (Figure 5-107) combines several plug ends on a common handle.</p>
<p>Socket-type plug wrenches (Figure 5-108) are usually combined in sets with an assortment of handles. The set will contain several sizes.</p>
 	 
<h5>Torque Wrenches</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-109" class="">Typical torque wrenches.</figure>

<p>Torque wrenches (Figure 5-109) are designed to measure the specific degree of tightness of nuts or bolts. Torque wrenches are considered precision instruments and therefore must be calibrated at regular intervals. Three types of torque wrenches are available: deflecting beam, dial-indicating, and micrometer-setting.</p>
<p>Torque wrenches are used for a final tightening of nuts or bolts. Torque wrenches are normally calibrated in a right- hand direction only. If a unit is required to perform torquing operations in a left- hand direction, they must request that the supporting calibration facility calibrate the torque wrench in both directions.</p>
<p>A deflecting beam torque wrench has a rod that runs parallel to the handle and the drive element. The rod moves across the scale to the right or left as torque is applied.
 
   <!--page 26-->

A dial-indicating torque wrench has a head that contains the drive element and a dial for reading the exact amount of torque.
The micrometer-setting torque wrench indicates the torque value by sound.   </p>

<h5>Torque Multipliers</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-110" class="">Torque multipliers.</figure>

<p>Torque multipliers are geared devices attached to the torque wrench (Figure 5-110) to increase the force of torque. The preferred ratio of the torque multiplier is 4 to 1. To use a torque multiplier, select one with an output capacity above the required torque. The torque multiplier is used for tightening nuts and bolts requiring 200 or more foot pounds of torque. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s operating manual to avoid personnel injury and damage to the equipment.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
A special feature of these types of torque wrenches is that it is possible to loosen as well as tighten nuts and bolts.</div>

<h5>Spanner Wrenches</h5>
<p>Two basic types of spanner wrenches are the hook-type and the pin-type. Hook-type spanner wrenches are either fixed (Figure 5-111) or adjustable (Figure 5-112) and are normally used to tighten fire hoses or similar couplings that have a protruding lip. Pin-type spanner wrenches (Figure 5-113) have pins protruding from the handle that fit into holes in the coupling or plate to be tightened or loosened. Spanner wrenches are special-purpose wrenches and are to be used only for their  intended purpose.</p>

        <figure data-id="5-111" class="">Fixed hook spanner wrench.</figure>
        <figure data-id="5-112" class="">Adjustable hook spanner wrench.</figure>
        <figure data-id="5-113" class="">Pin-type spanner wrench.</figure>

   <!--page 27-->
        <figure data-id="5-114" class="">Fixed-pin face spanner wrench.</figure>

        <figure data-id="5-115" class="">Adjustable-pin face spanner wrench.</figure>
<p>Three kinds of hook-type wrenches include the hose coupling pin, for tightening and loosening hose couplings, the fixed hook for tightening or loosening couplings with protruding rims or edges, and the adjustable hook-type.</p>
<p>The adjustable hook-type is similar to the fixed hook-type. However, it may be adjusted around objects and fastened before use.</p>
<p>There are two basic pin-type wrenches. The fixed-pin face (Figure 5-114) has been designed to fit a particular pattern and is nonadjustable.
    The fixed-pin face is used to remove protective cover plates. The adjustable-pin face (Figure 5-115) has two arms joined at a common point. The other end of the arms contains pins that may be engaged in the holes of a cover plate for removal.</p>

<h5>Using a Box Wrench</h5>
<p>Follow these steps to use a nonadjustable wrench:</p>
<ol><li>Select the size of wrench that fits the nut or bolt.</li>
   <li> Place the wrench on the nut or bolt (Figure 5-116). Swing the wrench clockwise to tighten and counterclockwise to loosen for a right-hand-threaded nut or bolt. Reverse the above for a left-hand- threaded nut or bolt.</li>
   <li>If there is insufficient room to swing the wrench in a full circle, lift it completely off the nut when it comes to the limit of the swing, and place it in a new position, permitting another swing. A swing through of a 15-degree arc is usually sufficient to continuously loosen or tighten a nut or bolt.</li>
   <li>After the nut is tight, give it a final tightening.</li></ol>

<h5>Using a Socket Wrench</h5>
        <figure data-id="5-116" class="">Place the correct size of wrench on the nut or bolt.</figure>

<p>Follow these steps to use a socket wrench:</p>
<ol><li>Select the size of socket that fits the nut or bolt to be turned and push it onto the handle that is best suited to the job (Figure 5-117).</li>
   <li>If there is room to swing, use the ratchet handle (The handle may be made to ratchet in one direction for tightening work and in the other direction for loosening work).</li>
    <li>Swing the handle back and forth to turn the nut in the desired direction (The socket need not be raised from the nut at the end of each swing).</li>
    <li>To loosen a tight nut, or to set up a nut, swing the hinged handle at right angles to the socket to provide the most leverage (Figure 5-118). At the point where the nut turns easily, swing the handle to a vertical position and twist rapidly between your fingers in the same manner as a screwdriver.</li>
    </ol>

<ol><li>Set the jaw to the correct size for the nut or bolt.</li>
   <li>Make sure the wrench jaws are fully tightened on the nut or bolt (Figure 5-119).</li>
    <li>Pull the wrench toward you as much as you can. If you must push the wrench, keep your hand open to avoid pinching it.</li>
    <li>Pull so that the force is on the fixed side of the jaw.</li>
    <li>Make sure there is enough room for your fingers as you turn the wrench.</li></ol>

<h4>Using an Adjustable Strap Pipe Wrench</h4>
<p>Follow these steps to use an adjustable strap pipe wrench:</p>
<ol><li>Loop the strap around the pipe in the opposite direction to that in which the pipe is to be rotated (Figure 5-120).</li>
    <li>Slip the end of the strap through the shackle and draw it up tightly.</li>

  <h4>Using a Spanner Wrench</h4>
          <figure data-id="5-123" class="">Using a spanner wrench.</figure>

<p>Follow these steps to use a spanner wrench (Figure 5-123):</p>
<ol><li>Insert the pins or lugs into the pin holes of the part.</li>
    <li>Keep the pin face of the wrench flush against the surface and turn the wrench.</li>
    <li>Exert enough force against the wrench so that the pins do not pop out of the holes.</li>
    <li>Make certain that the pins fit the holes and the force is applied with the handle perpendicular to the work.</li>
    <li>Remove the wrench when desired tightness is obtained.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Wrenches</h4>
<p>When using a wrench, you must follow many guidelines for your own safety and that of others, as well as for maintaining your tool. Use the following guidelines when working with wrenches:</p>
    
<ul><li>Wrenches should fit the nuts or bolts they are to loosen or tighten.</li>
    <li>Never turn adjustable wrenches so that the pulling force is applied to the adjustable jaw.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to extend the handle in any way to increase the leverage on a wrench. Increased leverage may damage the wrench or the work.</li>
    <li>Brace your stance in case the wrench releases or the fastener slips suddenly.</li>
    <li>Apply penetrating oil to rusted nuts and/or bolts that resist turning. Allow time for oil to penetrate before attempting to turn.</li>
    <li>When you have to break loose a frozen fastener, use a box wrench with a striking face or a heavy-duty socket wrench with an appropriate-size sledgehammer.</li>
    <li>Do not strike wrenches with hammers to tighten or loosen nuts or bolts.</li>
    <li>Do not exert a hard pull on a pipe wrench until it has gripped the work firmly.</li>
    <li>Remember to pull on the wrench, when possible, in order to protect your knuckles in case the wrench slips.</li>
    <li>Return all wrenches to their proper places upon completion of each job, thus eliminating the possibility of leaving them where they can injure someone.</li>
    <li>Always keep the wrench in good condition, clean, and free from oil or grease. Otherwise, it may slip, resulting in possible serious injury to you or damage to the work.</li>
    <li>Store torque wrenches as follows:</li>
  <ul>  <li>When storing the micrometer-type torque wrenches or beam-type torque wrenches, check to make sure they are returned to zero before storing.</li>
        <li>For the rest of the torque wrenches (unless your local standard operating procedures states differently), zero them before you store them. Zeroing the torque wrench takes the pressure off the spring, and the wrenches will last longer and give better service.</li>
         </ul>
         
           <!--page 32-->
           
    <li>Apply a thin film of oil to the metal parts of all wrenches before storing them. Remove oil before use to prevent injury or damage.</li>
    <li>For long-term storage, the wrenches should be covered with a rust-preventive compound and carefully stored in a dry place.</li>
    <li>Use the correct wrench for the appropriate purpose. Avoid the following actions:</li>
   <ul> <li>Applying excessive torque on a wrench, which can strip or damage threads on the fastener.</li>
        <li>Using extension handles, also known as cheaters, to increase leverage. </li>
        <li>Using sockets intended for hand tools on a power tool or impact wrench.</li>
       <li>Using a torque wrench as a conventional wrench.</li>
    <li>Using the wrench as a hammer.</li></ul></ul>


<h3>BARS</h3>
<p>Bars are steel tools used to lift and move heavy objects and to pry where leverage is needed. They can also be used to remove nails and spikes, and to loosen hard soil for digging. The most commonly used types of bars are the wrecking bar, chisel (Wonder) bar, flat bar, and cat’s paw. These bars range from 12 to 72 inches in length, depending upon their design and the purpose for which they are used. The bars should be used in a position where the weight of the user’s body is exerted downward on the long section of the lever. When possible, use a block or other object as a fulcrum behind the bar, near the spot where the bar’s point is wedged under the object to be moved.</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
          <figure data-id="5-124" class="">Wrecking bar.</figure>

<h5>Wrecking Bar</h5>
<p>The wrecking bar (Figure 5-124) is used for demolition, pulling nails, ripping wood, and other similar tasks. The length of the wrecking bar gives it better leverage for pulling larger and longer nails.</p>

<h5>Chisel (Wonder) Bar</h5>
          <figure data-id="5-125" class="">Chisel (Wonder) bar.</figure>

<p>The chisel bar (Figure 5-125) gets you into tight spots for prying, although it is not designed for heavy-duty prying. It is useful for removing nails with exposed heads and for prying paneling or molding without marring the surface. You can drive it into wood to split and rip apart the pieces.
    </p>

<h5>Flat Bar</h5>
          <figure data-id="5-126" class="">Flat bar.</figure>

<p>The flat bar (Figure 5-126) is a small pry bar. It is usually 2 inches wide and 15 inches long, with a nail slot at the end to pull nails out from tightly enclosed areas.</p>
   <!--page 33-->
<h5>Cat’s Paw</h5>
          <figure data-id="5-127" class="">Cat’s paw.</figure>

<p>The cat’s paw (Figure 5-127) is used to pull nails when the nail heads are buried beneath the wood’s surface. Hammer the forked chisel head into the wood surrounding the nail head until the nail head is positioned between the notches, and then pull it from below the wood surface.</p>

<h4>Using a Pry Bars</h4>
<p>Follow these steps when you use a pry bar:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Use the angled prying end (Figure 5-128) to force apart pieces of wood.</li>
    <li>Use the heavy claw end (Figure 5-129) to pull large nails and spikes.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Bars</h4>
<p>When using a bar, you must follow many guidelines for your own safety and that of others, as well as for maintaining your tool. Use the following guidelines when working with bars:</p>
    
<ul><li>Wrecking bars are exceptionally heavy; take extreme care to keep them from falling and striking someone.</li>
    <li>When using bars for prying, make sure the bar does not slip and cause personal injury.</li>
    <li>Do not use bars for extra-heavy work because they will bend and may cause injury.</li>
    </ul>
