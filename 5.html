<h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
<h2>FASTENING AND PRYING TOOLS</h2>
<p>Fastening and prying tools are made to either put things together or take things apart. These tools include pliers, hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, and bars.
In this chapter, you will learn about different types of fastening and prying tools and their uses. You will also learn how to select the right tool for the job, use and read various types of tools, and provide the proper care of fastening and prying tools to keep them in good working condition.</p>

</ol>

<h3>PLIERS</h3>
<p>Pliers (Figure 5-1) are a special type of adjustable wrench that are scissor-shaped tools with jaws. The jaws usually have teeth to help grip objects and are adjustable because the two handles move on a pivot. Pliers are made of hardened steel and come with different head styles that determine their use. Pliers are used to hold, cut, and bend wire and soft metals.
</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h5>Slip-Joint Pliers</h5>

<p>The slip-joint combination pliers (Figure 5-1) have serrated (grooved) jaws, a rod-gripping section, a cutting edge, and a pivot. The serrated jaws and rod-gripping section are used to hold objects. The cutting edge permits the cutting of soft wire and nails. However, cutting hard materials or large-gauge wire will spring the jaws, making the pliers useless. The pivot is used to adjust the jaw opening to handle large or small objects.</p>

<h5>Diagonal Cutting Pliers</h5>
   
    <p>The diagonal cutting pliers (Figure 5-2) have a fixed pivot. The jaws are offset by about 15 degrees and are shaped to give enough knuckle clearance while making flush cuts. The diagonal cutting pliers are used for cutting small, light materials, such as wire, cotter pins, and similar materials. These pliers are not to be used to hold or grip objects.</p>

<h5>Lineman’s Pliers</h5>

<p>The lineman’s pliers (Figure 5-3) have serrated jaws, a rod-gripping section, side cutters, a wire cropper, a fixed pivot, and parallel handles. The flat, serrated jaws are
    used to bend sheet metal and twist electrical wire. The rod- gripping section is used to hold rods and bend small rods. The side cutters are located just above the pivot point, where maximum pressure may be applied.</p>
    
<figure data-id="5-3" class="float-right">Lineman’s pliers.</figure>

<p>They are ground at an angle, permitting sharp flush cuts on electrical wire. A pair of croppers is located above the
    pivot. They are used to shear larger wire. Lineman’s pliers used around electrical circuits have insulated sleeves over the handles to reduce the possibility of electrical shock.</p>

<h5>Parallel Jaw Pliers</h5>
<p>The parallel jaw pliers (Figure 5-4) are constructed so that the jaws remain parallel to each other throughout the entire distance of travel. They have two jaws two jaws, a pivot pin, curved handles, and tension springs. The tension springs are contained within the curved handles and will open the jaws when the handles are released. These pliers are used to grip objects that have flat surfaces.</p>

<h5>Long Nose Pliers (Needle Nose Pliers)</h5>
<p>Long nose pliers, also known as needle nose pliers, are shown in Figure 5-5. The pointed nose makes them useful for work in tight places where other pliers cannot reach. The jaws and cutting blades meet evenly.</p>

<h5>Flat Nose Pliers</h5>
<p>The flat nose pliers (Figure 5-6) have flat serrated jaws, a fixed pivot, and curved handles that may have insulated sleeves. These pliers are used to bend light sheet metal and wire.</p>

<h5>Round Nose Pliers</h5>
<p>The round nose pliers (Figure 5-7) are used to make loops in soft wire. It has jaws that are smooth and round, a fixed pivot, and curved handles, which may have insulated sleeves.</p>

<h5>Straight-Lip Flat-Jaw Tongs</h5>
<p>The straight-lip flat-jaw tongs (Figure 5-8) have two straight jaws, a fixed pivot point, and long, straight handles. These tongs are used to hold bearings and bearing inserts while they are set in place.</p>

<h5>End Cutting Pliers</h5>
<p>The end cutting pliers (Figure 5-9) are used to cut wire flush to the working surface. They are designed to keep hands and fingers safely away from the wire ends.</p>

<h5>Wire Strippers (Multipurpose)</h5>
<p>Wire strippers (Figure 5-10) are used to strip insulation from electrical cord. When closed around wire, only the insulation is cut. The wire core remains undamaged.</p>

<h5>Vise Grip (Locking) Pliers</h5>
<p>A vise grip (Figure 5-11) is a type of locking pliers. One side of the handle has an adjusting screw used to set the size of the jaws. Some models also include a lever on the opposite side of the bolt to unlock the pliers by pushing the handles apart.</p>

<h5>Tongue and Groove (Channel Lock) Pliers</h5>
<p>Tongue and groove pliers, also known as channel lock pliers, are shown in Figure 5-12. They have multiple size adjustments that make them good for gripping and applying limited torque to round, square, flat, and hexagonal objects. Their jaws may be straight, smooth, or curved. They are used mostly in plumbing and electrical.</p>

<h5>Wire-Twister Pliers or Safety Wire Pliers</h5>
<p>Wire-twister pliers or safety wire pliers (Figure 5-13) are three-way pliers: they hold, twist, and cut. Safety wiring is the most positive and satisfactory method of safety tying. It  is a method of wiring two or more units. The tendency of one unit to loosen is counteracted by the tightening of the wire.

To operate, grasp the wire between the two diagonal jaws, and the thumb will bring the locking sleeve into place. A pull on the knob twirls the twister, making uniform twists in the wire. The spiral rod may be pushed back into the twister without unlocking it, and another pull on the knob will give a tighter twist to the wire. A squeeze on the handle unlocks the twister, and the wire can be cut to the desired length with the side cutter. The spiral of the twister should be lubricated occasionally. Examples of safety wiring nuts, bolts, and screws are illustrated in Figure 5-14. The Examples 1, 2, and 5 illustrate the proper method of safety wiring bolts, screws, square head plugs, and similar parts that are wired in pairs. In Examples 6 and 7, a single-threaded component wired to a housing or lug is shown. In Example 3, several components are wired in series. The proper method of wiring castellated nuts and studs is shown in Example 4. Note that there is no loop around the nut.</p>

<h4>Using Slip-Joint Pliers</h4>

<div class="alert alert-note">NOTE
The following procedure for bending the ends of a cotter pin after installation is not the only use of slip-joint pliers.</div>
 
<p>Use slip-joint pliers as follows:</p>

<ol><li>With the cotter pin installed, push the rounded head of the cotter pin with the thumb of one hand. Grasp the long section of the cotter pin with the pliers (Figure 5-15), and bend it back flat against the metal surface or nut.</li>
    <li>Grasp the other section of the cotter pin and bend it back flat against the metal surface or nut (Figure 5-16).</li>
    <li>Adjust the pliers to obtain a wide jaw opening (Figure 5-17).</li>

<div class="alert alert-caution">CAUTION
Too much pressure can break the cotter pin or spring the plier jaws.
</div>

<li>Place the plier jaws around both bent ends of the cotter pin (Figure 5-18) and apply pressure on the handles, bending the cotter pin ends flush.</li>
</ol>
