<h3>PLIERS</h3>
<p>Pliers (Figure 5-1) are a special type of adjustable wrench that are scissor-shaped tools with jaws. The jaws usually have teeth to help grip objects and are adjustable because the two handles move on a pivot. Pliers are made of hardened steel and come with different head styles that determine their use. Pliers are used to hold, cut, and bend wire and soft metals.
</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<h5>Slip-Joint Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-1" class="float-right">Parts of a pliers.</figure>
<p>The slip-joint combination pliers (Figure 5-1) have serrated (grooved) jaws, a rod-gripping section, a cutting edge, and a pivot. The serrated jaws and rod-gripping section are used to hold objects. The cutting edge permits the cutting of soft wire and nails. However, cutting hard materials or large-gauge wire will spring the jaws, making the pliers useless. The pivot is used to adjust the jaw opening to handle large or small objects.</p>

<h5>Diagonal Cutting Pliers</h5>
   <figure data-id="5-2" class="float-right">Diagonal cutting pliers.</figure>
    <p>The diagonal cutting pliers (Figure 5-2) have a fixed pivot. The jaws are offset by about 15 degrees and are shaped to give enough knuckle clearance while making flush cuts. The diagonal cutting pliers are used for cutting small, light materials, such as wire, cotter pins, and similar materials. These pliers are not to be used to hold or grip objects.</p>

<h5>Lineman’s Pliers</h5>

<p>The lineman’s pliers (Figure 5-3) have serrated jaws, a rod-gripping section, side cutters, a wire cropper, a fixed pivot, and parallel handles. The flat, serrated jaws are
    used to bend sheet metal and twist electrical wire. The rod- gripping section is used to hold rods and bend small rods. The side cutters are located just above the pivot point, where maximum pressure may be applied.</p>
    
<figure data-id="5-3" class="float-right">Lineman’s pliers.</figure>

<p>They are ground at an angle, permitting sharp flush cuts on electrical wire. A pair of croppers is located above the
    pivot. They are used to shear larger wire. Lineman’s pliers used around electrical circuits have insulated sleeves over the handles to reduce the possibility of electrical shock.</p>

<h5>Parallel Jaw Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-4" class="float-right">Parallel jaw pliers.</figure>
<p>The parallel jaw pliers (Figure 5-4) are constructed so that the jaws remain parallel to each other throughout the entire distance of travel. They have two jaws two jaws, a pivot pin, curved handles, and tension springs. The tension springs are contained within the curved handles and will open the jaws when the handles are released. These pliers are used to grip objects that have flat surfaces.</p>

<h5>Long Nose Pliers (Needle Nose Pliers)</h5>
<figure data-id="5-5" class="float-right">Long nose (needle nose) pliers.</figure>
<p>Long nose pliers, also known as needle nose pliers, are shown in Figure 5-5. The pointed nose makes them useful for work in tight places where other pliers cannot reach. The jaws and cutting blades meet evenly.</p>

<h5>Flat Nose Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-6" class="float-right">Flat nose pliers.</figure>
<p>The flat nose pliers (Figure 5-6) have flat serrated jaws, a fixed pivot, and curved handles that may have insulated sleeves. These pliers are used to bend light sheet metal and wire.</p>

<h5>Round Nose Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-7" class="float-right">Round nose pliers.</figure>
<p>The round nose pliers (Figure 5-7) are used to make loops in soft wire. It has jaws that are smooth and round, a fixed pivot, and curved handles, which may have insulated sleeves.</p>

<h5>Straight-Lip Flat-Jaw Tongs</h5>
<figure data-id="5-8" class="float-right">Straight-lip flat-jaw tongs.</figure>
<p>The straight-lip flat-jaw tongs (Figure 5-8) have two straight jaws, a fixed pivot point, and long, straight handles. These tongs are used to hold bearings and bearing inserts while they are set in place.</p>

<h5>End Cutting Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-9" class="float-right">End cutting pliers.</figure>
<p>The end cutting pliers (Figure 5-9) are used to cut wire flush to the working surface. They are designed to keep hands and fingers safely away from the wire ends.</p>

<h5>Wire Strippers (Multipurpose)</h5>
<figure data-id="5-10" class="float-right">Wire strippers (multipurpose).</figure>
<p>Wire strippers (Figure 5-10) are used to strip insulation from electrical cord. When closed around wire, only the insulation is cut. The wire core remains undamaged.</p>

<h5>Vise Grip (Locking) Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-11" class="float-right">Vise grip (locking) pliers.</figure>
<p>A vise grip (Figure 5-11) is a type of locking pliers. One side of the handle has an adjusting screw used to set the size of the jaws. Some models also include a lever on the opposite side of the bolt to unlock the pliers by pushing the handles apart.</p>

<h5>Tongue and Groove (Channel Lock) Pliers</h5>
<figure data-id="5-12" class="float-right">Tongue and groove (channel lock) pliers.</figure>
<p>Tongue and groove pliers, also known as channel lock pliers, are shown in Figure 5-12. They have multiple size adjustments that make them good for gripping and applying limited torque to round, square, flat, and hexagonal objects. Their jaws may be straight, smooth, or curved. They are used mostly in plumbing and electrical.</p>

<h5>Wire-Twister Pliers or Safety Wire Pliers</h5>

 <figure data-id="5-13" class="float-right">Wire-twister or safety wire pliers.</figure>

 <figure data-id="5-14" class="float-right">Safety wire methods.</figure>

<p>Wire-twister pliers or safety wire pliers (Figure 5-13) are three-way pliers: they hold, twist, and cut. Safety wiring is the most positive and satisfactory method of safety tying. It  is a method of wiring two or more units. The tendency of one unit to loosen is counteracted by the tightening of the wire.

<!-- Page 4 -->

To operate, grasp the wire between the two diagonal jaws, and the thumb will bring the locking sleeve into place. A pull on the knob twirls the twister, making uniform twists in the wire. The spiral rod may be pushed back into the twister without unlocking it, and another pull on the knob will give a tighter twist to the wire. A squeeze on the handle unlocks the twister, and the wire can be cut to the desired length with the side cutter. The spiral of the twister should be lubricated occasionally. Examples of safety wiring nuts, bolts, and screws are illustrated in Figure 5-14. The Examples 1, 2, and 5 illustrate the proper method of safety wiring bolts, screws, square head plugs, and similar parts that are wired in pairs. In Examples 6 and 7, a single-threaded component wired to a housing or lug is shown. In Example 3, several components are wired in series. The proper method of wiring castellated nuts and studs is shown in Example 4. Note that there is no loop around the nut.</p>

<h3>HAMMERS</h3>
<p>A hammer is a tool used to deliver an impact to an object. Hammers are mostly used to drive nails, fit parts, or break up objects. There are many types of hammers designed for specific uses, which vary in shape and structure. Most hammers include a handle and a head, with most of the weight in the head. The strongest, safest hammers have heads made of tough alloy (two or more metals) or drop-forged steel. The two main types of hammers are claw and ball peen.</p>

 
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Claw Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-23" class="float-right">Parts of a claw hammer.</figure>
<p>The parts of a claw hammer are shown in Figure 5-23. Use the flat head to drive nails, wedges, and dowels. Use the two-pronged claw to remove nails from wood.</p>
<h5>Bell-faced Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-24" class="float-right">Bell-faced hammer.</figure>
<p>The bell-faced hammer (Figure 5-24) has a slightly rounded (convex) face. It takes some practice to become skilled with this hammer, but it can help you drive a nail head flush to the wood without marring the surface of the wood.</p>

<!-- page 8 -->

<h5>Finish Hammer</h5>
<p>The finish hammer (Figure 5-25) is a claw hammer used for cabinet making, finishing, and general carpentry. It has a lightweight head with a smooth face that keeps it from marring the surface of the wood. It has a curved claw for removing nails from wood.</p>

 <figure data-id="5-25" class="float-right">Finish hammer.</figure>
 <figure data-id="5-26" class="float-right">Framing hammer.</figure>
 <figure data-id="5-27" class="float-right">Milled or waffle face.</figure>

<h5>Framing Hammer</h5>
<p>The framing hammer (Figure 5-26) is a claw hammer with an oversized head used in framing carpentry. The larger, heavier head improves the user's accuracy and decreases the number of blows required to fully drive the nail into the wood. This hammer may leave slight indentations in the surface of the wood, but that is not important in rough carpentry. The claw on a framing hammer is straighter than on a regular claw hammer; it is used to pry apart nailed boards.Framing hammers often have a milled or waffle face, as shown in Figure 5-27, which helps prevent the hammer from slipping off the nail head if the nail is not struck precisely.</p>

<h5>Ball Peen Hammer</h5>
 <figure data-id="5-28" class="float-right">Parts of a ball peen hammer.</figure>
<p>The parts of a ball peen hammer are shown in Figure 5-28. A ball peen hammer is used on metal for tasks, such as riveting, center punching, and bending or</p>
<p>shaping soft metal. The head of this hammer is soft and will dent if used to pound nails.</p>

<h3>SCREWDRIVERS</h3>
 <figure data-id="5-60" class="">Parts of a screwdriver.</figure>
<p>A screwdriver (Figure 5-60) is a device used to insert and tighten screws or to loosen and remove screws. A screwdriver has a head or tip that connects with a screw, a mechanism to apply torque by rotating that tip, and a way to position and support the screwdriver. A typical manual screwdriver is made up of a roughly cylindrical handle, with a shaft fixed to the handle, including a tip shaped to fit a particular type of screw. The handle and shaft support and position the screwdriver, and apply torque when rotated. The blade is made of tempered steel so it will resist wear, bending, and breaking.</p>
<p>There are many different types of screwdrivers, identified by the type of screws they fit. Some of the more common types of screwdrivers are flat head, Phillips® head, clutch drive, TORX, Robertson, and Allen (hex).</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
 <figure data-id="5-61" class="">Flat (slot) head screwdriver.</figure>

<h4>Care of Screwdrivers</h4>
<p>When using a screwdriver, you must follow many guidelines for your own safety and that of others, as well as for maintaining your tool. Use the following guidelines when working with screwdrivers:</p>

<ul>Always use eye protection.
     
<li>Visually inspect your screwdriver before using it. When a screwdriver becomes nicked, when its edges become rounded, or when other damage occurs so that it does not fit a screw slot, it can be reground or filed. The sides must be parallel to keep the tool from lifting from the screw slot, and the tip must be square, at right angles to the sides and to the blade.</li>
     
<li>The plastic handles on screwdrivers should be fire and heat resistant.
         </li>     
     <!-- page 20 -->
     <li>Do not expose a screwdriver to excessive heat because it may reduce the hardness of the blade.</li>
     
     <li>Replace a screwdriver that has a worn or damaged handle or rounded tip.</li>
     
     <li>Keep the screwdriver free of dirt, grease, and grit so the blade will not slip out of the screw head slot. After use, wipe the screwdriver clean and place it in a rack or tool box. For long-term storage, apply rust-preventive compound to all metal surfaces and store it in a dry place.</li>
     
     <li>Screwdrivers used in the shop are best stored in a rack. By storing screwdrivers in a rack, the proper selection of the right screwdriver can be quickly made and fewer injuries will result.</li>
     
     <li>Use the right size of screwdriver for the screw you are driving to avoid having the screwdriver slip. Using the wrong size can also damage the screwdriver or the screw head.</li>
     
     <li>File the blade tip to restore a worn straightedge.</li>
     
     <li>Place the material with which you are working on a work surface and secure it with a clamp or vise.</li>
     
    <li> When you are starting the screw, it is easy to hurt your fingers if the blade slips. Work with caution.</li>
     
    <li> Use screwdrivers for the appropriate purpose and in the correct way. Avoid the following actions:</li>
     <ul>
         
   <li> Using the screwdriver as a punch, chisel, or pry bar.</li>

    <li>Using a screwdriver to score or scrape.</li>

    <li>Using the screwdriver near live wires or as an electrical tester.</li>
     
     <li>Pointing the screwdriver blade toward yourself or anyone else. </li>
     
    <li> Carrying a screwdriver in your pocket.</li>

    <li>Using pliers for added turning leverage on the shank of a screwdriver (A wrench may be used on square-shank screwdrivers).</li>
     </ul>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>WRENCHES</h3>
<p>A wrench is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage when torque is applied to hold and turn bolts, nuts, screws, and pipes. Wrenches are forged from steel alloy to prevent breakage. Wrenches are divided into two categories: nonadjustable and adjustable. Nonadjustable wrenches are made to work on a particular size of bolt, nut, screw, or pipe. Adjustable wrenches are made to tighten or loosen a particular size of bolt, nut, screw, or pipe.</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
 <figure data-id="5-77" class="">Open-end wrench.</figure>
 
<h5>Open-End Wrench</h5>
<p>All open-end wrenches have open jaws on one or both ends of the wrench. Most jaw openings are offset from the shank portion of the wrench by 15 degrees. The wrench length is determined by the size of the jaw opening.
    The open-end wrench (Figure 5-77) grips on two sides of the nut or bolt head, with an opening that can access fasteners that a closed, or box, wrench might not reach. It has openings of different sizes on each end. The opening should fit the nut or bolt exactly to prevent mutilating the edges of the fastener. They can come in sets.</p>
