<h3>SAWS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>Saws are tools with thin flat steel blades that have a row of spaced notches or “teeth” along the edge. The blade is fastened to a handle. Saws are available in various sizes and designs depending on their use and the material to be cut. The most common types of saws are handsaw (crosscut and ripsaw), one-man crosscut saw, two-man crosscut saw, backsaw, nest-of-saws, compass (keyhole) saw, coping saw, dovetail saw, and hacksaw.</p>

<h5>Handsaw</h5>
<figure data-id="6-1" class="">Parts of a saw.</figure>

<p>The handsaw consists of a thin flat blade with teeth and a wooden or plastic handle (Figure 6-1), called the heel, fastened to the end of the blade by screws. The handsaw is used in carpentry, rough-out work, and for “finish” hand sawing. Sizes of handsaws vary depending on design and nature of the task. There are two categories of handsaws: the ripsaw and the crosscut.
        The ripsaw, has large chisel-shaped teeth, usually 5 1/2
        teeth per inch. It is designed to cut with the wood grain,
    with teeth that are cross-filed to ensure the chisel point is set square to the direction of cutting. The ripping action of this saw produces a coarse ragged cut not desirable for finish work.</p>
<p>The crosscut saw has teeth shaped like knife points to crumble out wood between cuts. It is designed to cut across wood grain and produces a smoother cut than ripsaws. They can also be used to cut plywood.
    </p>
    
   
  <h5>One-Man Crosscut Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-2" class="">One-man crosscut saw.</figure>

<p>The one-man crosscut saw (Figure 6-2) is about 36 inches long and has a handle at one end. This type of saw is characterized by a high-grade steel blade with two types of teeth known as cutters and rakers. The cutters do the cutting, and the rakers chisel out and remove chips from the cut. It is used for heavy work such as cutting down trees and sawing heavy timbers.</p>

<h5>Two-Man Crosscut Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-3" class="">Two-man crosscut saw.</figure>

<p>The two-man crosscut saw (Figure 6-3) is 5 to 6 1/2 feet long with a handle at each end. As with the one-man crosscut saw, it also has a high-grade steel blade with the cutter and raker teeth arrangement. It is used when two men are required for extra heavy cutting jobs.</p>

<h5>Backsaw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-4" class="">Backsaw.</figure>

<p>The backsaw (Figure 6-4) has a straight blade and parallel top and bottom, with a heavy strip of steel or brass wrapped along the back to provide rigidity. The handle is of similar shape to other handsaws except it is usually mounted higher. Backsaws are used for general bench work such as cutting joints and smaller sections of lumber to length. Sizes vary depending on design and nature of work.</p>

<h5>Nest-of-Saws</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-5" class="">Nest-of-saws.</figure>

<p>Nest-of-saws (Figure 6-5) consist of a wooden handle to which several different blades can be attached, making up different types of saws such as the keyhole or compass saw. A slotted end at the heel of each blade slips into the pistol-grip type handle where a wingnut fastens it in place. Nest-of- saws are used to cut along curved lines, to start cuts for larger saws, or to make starting saw cuts from drilled holes or small openings. The size of these saws will vary depending on design and nature of use.</p>


<h5>Compass (Keyhole) Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-6" class="">Compass (keyhole) saw.</figure>

<p>The compass saw (Figure 6-6) has a narrow blade that tapers nearly to a point. This point helps it to fit in tight spaces where larger saws would not fit.
    There are three or four blade styles that can be changed according to the cutting job. It cuts curves quickly in wood and wallboard.</p>
<p>A keyhole saw is a small compass saw with finer teeth, used to cut metal. Keyhole saw blades can come in a turret head model that can be rotated and locked in several positions to ease cutting in tight spots.</p>

<h5>Coping Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-7" class="">Coping saw.</figure>

<p>The coping saw (Figure 6-7) has a narrow flexible blade attached to a U-shaped frame. Blade holders at each end of the frame can be rotated so it can cut at any angle.
    This saw is used for cutting irregular shapes, curves, and intricate decorative patterns.</p>

<h5>Dovetail Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-8" class="">Dovetail saw.</figure>

<p>The dovetail saw (Figure 6-8) is similar to a backsaw with its stiff reinforced back, but it is smaller with finer teeth. It is used for fine finish cuts, such as dovetail joints. It is commonly used for trimming molding and repairing furniture. It can also be used to cut plastics and laminates.</p>

<h5>Hacksaw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-9" class="">Hacksaw.</figure>

<p>The hacksaw (Figure 6-9) is designed to cut almost any size or shape of metal object. The hacksaw uses two types of blades, hard and flexible. The type of blade used depends on the nature of the task. The blade is held to the saw frame by pins that fit into small holes at each end of the blade. Blade tension is adjusted by a screw and wingnut assembly at either the nose or the handle end of the frame. The hacksaw comes in various designs, depending on the purpose.

    <h4>Using the Crosscut Saw</h4>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying wood chips.
    </div>
    
    <p>The following steps describe how to use a crosscut saw properly:</p>
<ol><li>In using the crosscut saw, place the work on a level just below the knees. Place one sawhorse, bench, or other support fairly close to the line of cut.</li>
     
    <li>Begin the cut by placing your hand with the thumb in an upright position pressed against the blade away from the teeth (Figure 6-10).</li>
    <li>Start sawing slowly to prevent the blade from jumping off the cut line.</li>
    <li>After the blade is engaged, use partial cutting strokes and be sure to set the saw at the proper angle (Figure 6-11).</li>
    <li>During the cut, apply pressure only during the down stroke.</li>
    <li>When nearing the end of a cut, hold the waste side of the wood to prevent board breaking off unevenly.</li></ol>

  <figure data-id="6-11" class="">Proper saw angle.</figure>
  
 <h4>Using the Keyhole Saw</h4>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a keyhole saw properly:
    </p>
  <ol>
     <li>To make an inside-out cut, first drill a hole large enough to admit the point of the saw (Figure 6-12).</li>
     <li>Insert the saw blade and start to cut slowly (Figure 6-13), with a minimum of pressure.</li>
     <li>Be careful not to twist the blade too sharply, as the narrow blade will easily bend.</li>
  </ol>
  <figure data-id="6-12" class="">Drill a hole.</figure>
  <figure data-id="6-13" class="">Insert the saw blade.</figure>

<h4>Using the Hacksaw</h4>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear protective eyewear to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div>
 
<p>The following steps describe how to use a hacksaw properly:</p>

<ol><li>Insert the correct blade in the hacksaw frame and adjust the wingnut for proper tension.</li>
<li>Secure the material to be cut in a vise or other holding device to avoid vibration which may snap the blade.</li>
<li>To make an accurate cut, use a file to make a notch for guiding the first strokes of the saw (Figure 6-14).</li>
<li>Steady the saw by holding the handle with the right hand and the frame with the left.</li>
<li>Hold the blade parallel to the work surface and cut on the push stroke (Figure 6-15), being careful not to bear down too hard. Draw the blade back using no pressure each time.</li>
<li>Saw at a rate not to exceed 40 to 50 strokes per minute.</li></ol>

  <figure data-id="6-14" class="">Make a notch.</figure>
  <figure data-id="6-15" class="">Hold the blade parallel.</figure>
  
  <h4>Care of Saws</h4>
<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with saws:</p>
<ul>

<li>Always wear eye protection; either safety glasses or a face shield.</li>
<li>Make sure the teeth and blades are properly sharpened and set by a qualified professional; dull teeth can be a safety hazard.</li>
<li>Make sure the saw blade is clean and protected from rust. Use emery cloth to clean the blade and a coat of light machine oil to prevent rust.</li>
    <li>Lay the saw down gently.</li>
    <li>Keep the handsaw teeth away from contact with stone, concrete, or metal.</li>
     
    <li>Protect the teeth of any saw when the tool is not in use.</li>
    <li>Before using, inspect the tool. Do not use any damaged or broken saw.</li>
    <li>Store all tools in their proper places when not being used.</li>
    <li>Do not throw or drop any tools. If a saw is dropped, inspect immediately before reusing.</li>
    <li>Replace damaged saw handles with new ones immediately when needed.</li>
    <li>Always loosen the blade tension on a hacksaw when not in use.</li>
    <li>Always remove the nest-of-saw blade from the handle for storage.</li>
    <li>Choose a saw that is the right size and design for the type of material being cut.</li>
    <li>Brace yourself when you are sawing so the final cut doesn’t throw you off balance.</li>
    <li>Make sure the saw handle keeps your wrist in a natural position-horizontal to the piece being cut.</li>
    <li>Make sure the piece being cut is free of objects, such as screws or nails, which could make the saw buckle.</li>
    <li>When cutting longer stock, be sure the stock is properly supported.</li>
    <li>Use clamps or vises to steady or secure any loose material to be cut.</li>
    <li>Do not allow pointed or edged tools to lie around where they may injure someone.</li>
    <li>Be careful not to allow the fingers or other parts of the body to get in the line of cut.</li>
    <li>Do not use a tool for any purpose other than that for which it was designed.</li>
    <li>Avoid placing heavy tools or objects on saw blades as these objects can distort the blade.</li>
    <li>Do not force the saw if it binds. Use a wedge to spread the cut.</li>
    
    </ul>

  
  
 <h3>CHISELS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Woodworker's Chisels</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-16" class="">Socket-type chisel.</figure>

<p>There are two types of woodworker’s chisels, the socket- and tang-type. The socket-type (Figure 6-16) has a blade and socket handle forged of high carbon steel in a single casting. The wooden handle is inserted into the socket. This type of chisel is used to cut and pare off wood. Generally, socket-type chisels are used for heavier cutting when a hammer or mallet may be required for additional driving force.</p>
  <figure data-id="6-17" class="">Tang-type chisel.</figure>

<p>The tang-type chisel (Figure 6-17) is forged in a single casting. The handle is drilled and inserted over the tang and reinforced with a metal band. The tang-type chisels are also used to cut and pare wood. However, the driving force required is hand pressure only.</p>
 
<h5>Machinists’ Chisels</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-18" class="">Common shapes of chisels.</figure>

<p>Machinists’ chisels are classified according to the shape of their points, and the width of the cutting edge denotes their size. The most common shapes of chisels (Figure 6-18) are cold chisel, cape, round nose, and diamond point. Chisels are designed to cut and shape cold metal and are usually struck with a hammer. The flat or cold chisel is composed of hardened steel and has a tapered cutting edge on one end and a flat base on the other end.</p>
<p>The diamond point chisel (Figure 6-18) has a solid point on one end and a flat base on the other end. It is used for drawing and cutting holes in flat stocks and to cut V-grooves.</p>
<p>The cape chisel (Figure 6-18) has a small solid point on one end and a flat base on the other end. It is used for cutting keyways or slots in metal and square corners.</p>
<p>The round nose chisel (Figure 6-18) has a ground edge on one end, a flat base on the other end, and an octagon-shaped stock. It is used to align drilled holes, cut channels, cut oil grooves, and similar work.</p>

<h5>Track Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-19" class="">Track chisel.</figure>

<p>The track chisel (Figure 6-19) has a beveled point on one end and a flat face on the other end. The cutting edge is 1 3/8 inches wide; the overall length is 10 1/2 inches and it weighs 5 1/2 pounds. The track chisel is used with a 22-inch sledge hammer to remove track bolts, boiler rivet heads, and cut rail when a saw or cutting torch is not available.</p>

<h5>Rivet Buster Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-20" class="">Rivet buster chisel.</figure>

<p>The rivet buster chisel (Figure 6-20) has a single ground flat cutting edge on one end and a flat face on the other end. The cutting edge is about 3/4 of an inch wide and the overall length is about 9 inches. It is used for cutting off chassis rivets and in other difficult places which cannot be reached by other chisels.</p>

<h5>Masonry Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-21" class="">Masonry chisel.</figure>

<p>The masonry chisel (Figure 6-21) is used to cut masonry, such as concrete block and brick. There are also masonry chisels with teeth used for cutting soft stone.</p>

<h5>Flooring Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-22" class="">Flooring chisel.</figure>

<p>The flooring chisel (Figure 6-22) is used to remove flooring material. It has a larger head to increase the striking area.</p>

<h4>Using a Woodworker’s Chisel</h4>
     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection. Keep both hands back from the cutting edge at all times.
    </div>
<p>
 Use the wood chisel to make openings or notches in wooden material. Use the chisel to make a recess for butt-type hinges, such as door hinges. Follow these steps to use a wood chisel properly:</p>
  <figure data-id="6-23" class="">Using a woodworker’s chisel.</figure>

<ol><li>Use a pencil to outline the opening or recess to be chiseled.</li>
     
     <li>Set the chisel at one end of the outline. The edge of the chisel should be on the cross-grain line. The bevel should be facing the recess to be made.</li>
     
     <li>Strike the head of the chisel lightly with a mallet.</li>
     
     <li>Repeat the process at the other end of the outline, with the bevel of the chisel blade toward the recess.</li>
     
     <li>Make a series of cuts about 1/4 of an inch apart from one end of the recess to the other.</li>
     
     <li>Trim away the notched wood. Hold the chisel bevel-side down to slice inward from the end of the recess (Figure 6-23).</li>
     </ol>
 
<h4>Using a Machinist’s Cold Chisel</h4>
     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-note">The following procedure is designed for using a machinist’s cold chisel. However, cutting round stock is not the only use for this type of chisel.
    </div>   
<p>A cold chisel is used to cut metal, as long as that metal is softer than the steel that the chisel is made of. You can use it to cut rivets, nuts, and bolts made of brass, bronze, copper, or iron.</p>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a machinist’s cold chisel properly:</p>

<ol><li>Secure the material you need to cut in a vise.</li>
    <li>Use a holding tool to place the blade of the chisel where you want to cut the material.</li>
    <li>Hit the chisel handle with a ball peen hammer to force the chisel into and through the material (repeat if necessary).</li></ol>

  <h4>Using a Rivet Buster Chisel</h4>
  
      <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div> 
  
<p>The following steps describe how to use a rivet buster chisel properly:
      </p>
        <figure data-id="6-24" class="">Using a rivet buster chisel</figure>
      
<ol>
   <li>Place the cutting edge of the chisel firmly against the rivet shaft between the head and the metal (Figure 6-24).</li>
    
    <li>Grip the chisel firmly and strike chisel head with a machinist’s or sledge hammer.</li>
    
    <li>Continue striking chisel head until rivet head has been cut off.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Care of Chisels</h4>
<p>Use these guidelines when working with chisels:</p>

<ul>    <li>Always use eye protection.</li>
        
       <li> Plastic guards near the head of the chisel protect hands against mishits.</li>
        
        <li>Tip guards protect the sharpened tip of the chisel.</li>
        
        <li>Keep all chisels sharpened and in good working order. Sharpen the cutting edge of a chisel on an oilstone to produce a keen edge.</li>
        
     <ul>
     <li>Make sure the wood chisel blade is beveled at a precise 25-degree angle so it will cut well.</li>
     
     <li>Make sure the cold chisel blade is beveled at a 60-degree angle so it will cut well.</li>
     </ul>
     </ul>
    
<ul><li>Strike cold chisels only with a hand drilling, ball peen, or similar heavy hammer.</li>
    <li>The face diameter of the hammer should be about three-eighths of an inch larger than the chisel head.</li>
    <li>Discard any chisel with a cracked or chipped face.</li>
    <li>Discard any chisel with a head that is mushroomed or flattened.</li>
    <li>Use chisels for the appropriate purpose and in the correct way. Avoid the following:</li>
<ul><li>Using a cold chisel to cut or split stone or concrete.</li>
    <li>Using a wood chisel to cut metal, concrete, or stone.</li>
    <li>Using a chisel for prying or driving screws.</li>
    <li>Placing a chisel of any type in your pocket.</li></ul>
     
    <li>Store in racks or where they may not be chipped or broken.</li>
    <li>Lubricate with a light coat of oil before storing.</li>
    <li>Regrind broken or chipped edges before using.</li></ul>

  
  <h3>PUNCHES</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>There are two basic types of punches; solid-which are the most common, and hollow-which are usually designed for punching holes in leather, paper, and other similar materials. Solid punches are used to mark metal, drive pins, align holes and do other similar jobs.</p>

<h4>Center Punches</h4>
<p>There are two types of center punches, both used for starting drill holes.</p>
<p>The handheld-type (Figure 6-25) has a narrow, cone-shaped point terminating in a sharp conical tip. Handheld-types range from 1/8 to 5/8 of an inch in diameter and from 3 to 6 inches long. The handheld punch must be struck with a hammer.</p>
<p>The automatic type (Figure 6-26) has an adjustable regulator for determining the impact of the punch and also has interchangeable points. The automatic punch contains a tension spring for marking without the use of a hammer.</p>

        <figure data-id="6-25" class="">Handheld center punch.</figure>

        <figure data-id="6-31" class="">Starting punch.</figure>





<h4>Drift Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-27" class="">Drift punch.</figure>

<p>The drift punch (Figure 6-27) has a narrow tapered flat point. The points range in size from 1/8 to 1/2 of an inch in diameter with an overall length from 7 to 9 inches.
    Drift punches may be used to remove shafts, pins, and rivets (after heads have been removed), and align small parts.</p>

<h4>Alignment Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-28" class="">Alignment.</figure>

<p>The alignment punch (Figure 6-28) has a narrow tapered flat point. The points range in size from 1/8 to
    1/2 of an inch in diameter with an overall length of 12 to 15 inches. Alignment punches are used to line up mating parts for assembly. The punch should be large enough for the job. A punch that is too
    small may bend or break.</p>

<h4>Drive Pin Punch</h4>
        <!-- missing 6 - 29 Description (made assumption)-->
        <figure data-id="6-29" class="">Drive Pin.</figure>

<p>The drive pin punch (Figure 6-29) has a flat tip which may be tapered. Points may range in size from 0.03 to 1/2 of an inch and are from 3 to 6 inches
    long. Standard drive pin punches usually come in sets of nine. Drive pin punches are used to remove
    straight or tapered pins. The right size punch should be used for the pin being removed.</p>

<h4>Prick Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-30" class="">Prick punch.</figure>

<p>The prick punch (Figure 6-30) has a long conical-shaped point and ranges from 4 to 5 inches in overall length. It is used to mark soft metal.</p>

<h4>Starting Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-31" class="">Starting punch.</figure>

<p>The starting punch (Figure 6-31) has a strong tapered point capable of resisting applied force. It is used to start the removal of a pin from an assembly.</p>

<h4>Grommet-Inserting Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-32" class="">Grommet- inserting punch.</figure>

<p>The grommet-inserting punch (Figure 6-32) consists of two parts. The solid punch part has a tapered point and a flat shoulder. The round die part has flat ends with a bored hole in one end to receive the point of the punch. Grommet-inserting punches are used to form the flange on grommets, which are installed along the edges of flags, sails, mail bags, and similar items.</p>

<h4>Catapunch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-33" class="">Catapunch.</figure>

<p>The catapunch (Figure 6-33) consists of a pointed head mounted on a coiled spring shaft. It is used to mark centers on metal or wood without the use of a hammer.</p>


<h4>Metal Cutting Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-34" class="">Metal cutting punch.</figure>

<p>The metal cutting punch (Figure 6-34) has an open sharpened edge on one end and a solid shaft on the other end. The center portion of the punch is bowed for catching the metal scrap. The metal cutting punch ranges in size from 1/4 of an inch to 1 inch. Metal cutting punches are used to punch holes in thin sheet metal and require the use of a mallet or machinist’s hammer.</p>

 
<h4>Tinmen’s Hollow Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-35" class="">Tinmen’s hollow punch.</figure>

<p>The tinmen’s hollow punch (Figure 6-35) has a solid metal shank terminating in a sharpened hollowed end. It is used to punch holes through thin sheet metal.</p>

 
<h4>Sheet Metal Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-36" class="">Sheet metal punch.</figure>

<p>The sheet metal punch (Figure 6-36) is a heavy- duty steel punch approximately seven inches in length. It tapers to a fine point and must be struck to produce the hole. It is used to punch holes through sheet metal to take fastenings.</p>
  

<h4>Lever Punch</h4>
        <figure data-id="6-37" class="">Lever punch.</figure>

<p>The lever punch (Figure 6-37) incorporates an interchangeable punch and a matching die or anvil. The die backs up the material, prevents distortion, and leaves a clean hole. This type of punch is used to punch small round holes near the edges of metal or leather material.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-note">The procedure which follows is only one of many uses of a handheld center punch.
    </div>

        <figure data-id="6-38" class="">Using a center punch.</figure>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a center punch properly:</p>
        <figure data-id="6-39" class="">Using a drift punch.</figure>
<ol><li>Mark the material to be punched with an "X."</li>
    
    <li>Hold the punch over the mark. Tilt it so that you can align the tip with the center of the “X.”</li>
    
    <li>Position the punch upright and strike the blunt end of the punch with a hammer (Figure 6-38).</li>
    
    <li>Remove the punch and check your mark. If it is not in the center of the "X" or not deep enough, you will have to repeat the procedure.</li></ol>
 
 
<h4>Using a Drift Punch</h4>

     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div>
        <div class="alert alert-note">The removal of a pin from a shaft is only one of many uses for a drift punch.
    </div>
    
<p>The following steps describe how to use a drift punch properly:
    </p>
    
<ol>
   <li>Select a punch which is slightly smaller than the pin which is to be removed. Care must be taken when selecting a punch for removing a split pin. If the punch is too small, it may become lodged in the pin.</li>
    
    <li>Hold the punch over the center of the pin and tap the punch lightly with a hammer (Figure 6- 39), which should move the pin. It may be necessary to apply penetrating oil to the pin before it will move.
        </li>
    <li>Catch the pin before it falls out of the shaft. When the pin is about half way out of the shaft, you can let go of the punch.</li></ol>

<h4>Using an Alignment Punch</h4>

     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips. Do not strike this punch with a hammer.

<figure data-id="6-48" class="">Wheel glass cutter.
</figure>
<h3>GLASS CUTTERS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Wheel-Type Glass Cutter</h5>
<p>A glass cutter (Figure 6-48) is a hand tool used for controlled breaking of flat or sheet glass. The wheel glass cutter consists of a steel cutting wheel, notching teeth, and a holder. The cutting section is a wheel about 5 millimeters (mm) in diameter made of hardened steel or tungsten carbide, with the edge ground to a V-section.</p>
<figure data-id="6-49" class="">Circle glass cutter.
</figure>
<h5>Circle Glass Cutter</h5>
<p>The circle glass cutter (Figure 6-49) has an adjustable arm, a cutting head, and a suction cup clamp assembly. The cutting head scores a mark on the sheet of glass. The suction cup assembly provides an anchor. The circle glass cutter is used to cut circles in glass. The adjustable arm can be moved in the suction cup assembly to allow circles from 2 to 24 inches in diameter.</p>

<h5>Using a Wheel-Type Glass Cutter</h5>
     <div class="alert alert-warning">Use care when handling glass. Wear gloves to protect your hands. Wear eye protection to prevent eye injury.
    </div>
        <div class="alert alert-note">Draw the cutter over the line only one time. If it is necessary to recut a groove, do not use a new cutter.
    </div>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a wheel-type glass cutter properly:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Place padding (newspapers, a piece of carpet, or blanket) on a flat, level surface.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure the glass is clean. Apply alcohol along the line to be cut. Cleaning the glass prevents the cutting wheel from becoming gummed up while in use.</li>
    
    <li>Apply a drop of light machine oil to the cutting blade (Figure 6-50, view A).</li>
    
    <li>Hold down on the straight edge with one hand while holding the cutter in an upright position in the other hand (Figure 6-50, view B). Your forefinger should extend along the holder with your fingertip near the wheel.</li>
    
    <li>Place a straight edge along the line to be cut (Figure 6-50, view C). A wooden yardstick should be used when available, since wood will not slip easily on glass. The cutter will cut 1/16 of an inch from your mark, so adjust your guide before cutting.</li>
    
    <li>Start your cut at the far end of the pane of glass drawing the cutter toward you. It is important that you maintain proper pressure throughout the cut (Figure 6-50, view D). Correct pressure is indicated by a scratching sound. Too much pressure or a dull wheel will produce a crunching sound. Make a continuous mark from one edge to the other edge.</li>
    <figure data-id="6-50" class="">Using a wheel-type glass cutter.
</figure>
    <li>A proper cut is indicated by a slight crack in the surface. It is best seen from the side opposite the mark (Figure 6-50, view E).</li>
    
    <li>To cut a narrow strip from a large piece of glass, score a line and then tap gently underneath the score line with the cutter to open up an inch or so of the score line, as shown in Figure 6-50, view F.</li>
    
    <li>To part the glass, gently snap off the waste piece as shown in Figure 6-50, view G.</li>
    
   <li> Remaining chips may be removed by applying a downward twisting motion using the notches of the cutter or a pair of pliers (Figure 6-50, view H).</li>
    
    <li>You can smooth off the edges of glass intended for shelving or tabletops with an oilstone dipped in water, as illustrated in Figure 6-50, view I.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Cutters</h4>

<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with glass cutters:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Make sure cutting blades remain sharp. Sharpen dull blades with a file or oilstone.</li>
    
    <li>When not in use, apply a light film of oil on the cutting edges.</li>
     
    <li>Store cutters in such a way as to prevent the blades from accidentally making contact with personnel or other metal.</li>
    
    <li>For long periods of storage, coat entire cutter with rust-preventive compound and store in a dry place.</li></ul>

<h3>KNIVES</h3>

  <h3>BOLT AND CABLE CUTTERS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
         <div class="alert alert-warning">Bolt cutters are considered security items. Always secure these tools when not in use.
    </div>
 
<p>Bolt and cable cutters come with a variety of cutting edges which are designed for specific applications. They are shaped like giant shears with short blades and long handles. The handles are hinged at one end. The cutters are at the end of extensions, which are jointed in such a way that the inside joint is forced outward when the handles are
    closed. This action forces the cutting edges together with great force. Bolt cutters are made in lengths from 18 to 36 inches. The larger ones will cut mild steel bolts and rods up to 1/2 inch in diameter.</p>
         <figure data-id="6-58" class="">Center cut cutter.
</figure>
    
<h5>Center Cut Cutter</h5>
<p>The center cut cutter (Figure 6-58) is used for all general- purpose cutting. The cutting jaws are firmly fixed in line with the handles. The cutting edges are in the center of the jaw between equal levels. The longer handles increase the cutting capacity. The cutting capacities range from 3/16 to 1/2 of an inch for medium steel, and from 5/16 to 11/16 of an inch for soft steel. The handles range from 14- to 42-inch lengths.</p>
 
<h5>Clipper Cut Cutter</h5>
<p>The cutting edges of the clipper cut cutter (Figure 6-59) are in line with the handles and beveled almost entirely from one side. These cutters allow very close cutting of projecting ends. The cutting capacities range from 1/4 to 9/16 of an inch for medium steel, and from 5/16 to 11/16 of an inch for soft steel. The handles range from 14- to 42-inch lengths.</p>

<h5>Shear Cut, Flat Bar, and Strip Cutter</h5>
<p>Shear cut, flat bar, and strip cutters (Figure 6-60) are used to cut flat-soft, medium-hard bar, and strip stock. The cutting edges of the jaws pass each other in the manner of scissors, making a complete shear cut.</p>
 <figure data-id="6-59" class="">Clipper cut cutter.
</figure>
<figure data-id="6-60" class="">Shear cut, flat bar, and strip cutter.

<figure data-id="6-61" class="">Side nut splitter cutter.
</figure>
<h5>Side Nut Splitter Cutter</h5>
<p>The side nut splitter cutter (Figure 6-61) has the edge of the cutting jaws in line with the handles. When adjusted properly, the cutting edges will remain separated after the nut is split. This tool is used to split nuts off bolts without damaging the bolt. Cutting capacity is rated for a 3/8-inch
    bolt nut and is adjustable to 5/16 of an inch and 1/4 of an
    inch capacity. The handle is 24 inches long.</p>

<h5>Angular Cut Cutter</h5>
<p>Angular cut cutters (Figure 6-62) have the cutting edges offset 30 degrees from the handles. This offset angle is so the user can keep the work in sight. It is used for close cutting of soft or medium-hard metals. Cutting capacities range from 1/4 of an inch to 1/2 of an inch for medium steel. The handles range from 14 to 36 inches long.</p>
 
<h5>Shear Cut Cable Cutter</h5>
<p>Shear cut cable cutters (Figure 6-63) have curved interposing cutters. They are used to cut lead and rubber-covered cable, and communication cable. Cutting capacities for lead and rubber-covered cable is 1 3/8 inches for the 25 1/2-inch long handle, and 2 1/4 inches for the 37-inch long handle. The communication cable cutting capacity for the 25-1/2-inch long handle is 0.813 of an inch, and 0.998 of an inch for the 37-inch long handle.</p>

<h4>Using Center Cut Cutters</h4>

         <div class="alert alert-warning">When using bolt cutters, make sure your fingers are clear of the jaws and hinges. Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.</div>

        <div class="alert alert-caution">Use extreme care when using a cutter to avoid catching any part of the body or clothes between handles as pressure is applied to them.</div>
       
       <div class="alert alert-caution">Never attempt to cut spring wire or other tempered metal with bolt cutters; the jaws can be sprung or nicked.</div>
 
 <figure data-id="6-64" class="">Position the work in the cutter jaws.
</figure>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a center cut cutter properly:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Clamp or steady the work if unattached before cutting to prevent the cutters from slipping.</li>
    
    <li>Dry hands and handles of the cutter before using to prevent slipping.</li>
    
    <li>Position the work as far back as possible into the jaws (Figure 6-64) to prevent damage to the jaws as well as to reduce the pressure required for cutting.</li>
    
    <li>Stand at a right angle to the work being cut and apply steady pressure to the handles until the work has been cut off. Do not pry or twist with the handles while cutting.</li></ol>
 
<h4>Care of Bolt and Cable Cutters</h4>
<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with bolt and cable cutters:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Wear safety glasses when cutting.</li>
    
    <li>When using bolt cutters, make sure your fingers are clear of the jaws and hinges.</li>
    
    <li>Take care that the bolt head or piece of rod that is cut off does not fly and injure you or someone else. When the cutters are brought together rapidly, sometimes a bolt-head or piece of rod being cut off will fly some distance. The harder the material, the more it will fly.</li>
    
    <li>If it is necessary to cut electrical cable or wire which is already installed, be sure that the power is disconnected before using the cable cutter on it.</li>
    
    <li>Bolt cutters are fairly heavy, so make sure that they are stored in a safe place where they will not fall and injure someone.</li>
    
    <li>Replace worn cutters when necessary.</li>
    
    <li>Before storing, wipe dirt and grease from the cutter and coat the metal parts lightly with oil to prevent rust.</li>
    
    <li>Keep the adjusting screws just tight enough to ensure that the cutting edges meet along their entire length when the jaws are closed.</li>
    
    <li>Keep cutter jaws at right angles to the piece being cut, do not twist or pry with the tool while cutting.</li>
    
    <li>Do not sharpen edges too sharp. Leave the cutting edge approximately 1/64-inch thick for longer jaw life.</li>
    
    <li>Store the cutter in a special compartment of the tool box or on a shelf where it cannot fall.</li></ul>

<h3>SHEARS AND NIPPERS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>Various types of hand snips and hand shears are used for cutting and notching sheet metal. All of the snips, shears, and nibblers are either manual or power operated. Hand snips are necessary because the shape, construction, location, and position of the work to be cut frequently prevent the use of machine-cutting tools.</p>

<p>Hand snips are divided into two groups, straight and circular cuts. Those for straight cuts are straight snips, combination snips, bulldog snips, and compound lever shears. Those for circular cuts are circle, hawk’s bill, aviation, and Trojan snips. These snips are shown in Figure 6-74. The following is a brief description of each type of snip.</p>

<h5>Straight snips</h5>
<p>The straight snips (Figure 6-74) have straight jaws for straight-line cutting. To ensure strength, they are not pointed. These snips are made in various sizes and the jaws may vary from 2 to 4 1/2 inches. The overall length will also vary from 7 to 15 ¾ inches. The different size snips are made to cut different thicknesses of metal with 18 gauge steel as a minimum for the larger snips. These snips are available for right- or left-hand use.</p>

<h5>Combination snips</h5>
<figure data-id="6-74" class="">Hand snips and shears.
</figure>
<p>The combination snips (Figure 6-74) have straight jaws for straight cutting, but the inner faces of the jaws are sloped for cutting curves as well as irregular shapes. These snips are available in the same sizes and capacities as straight snips.</p>

<h5>Bulldog snips</h5>
<p>The bulldog snips (Figure 6-74) are a combination type. They have short cutting blades with long handles for leverage. The blades are inlaid with special alloy steel for cutting stainless steel. Bulldog snips can cut 16 gauge mild steel. The blades are 2 1/2 inches long and the overall length of the snip varies from 14 to 17 inches.</p>
 
<h5>Compound lever shears</h5>
<p>Compound lever shears (Figure 6-74) have levers designed to give additional leverage to ease the cutting of heavy material. The lower blade is bent to allow the shears to be inserted in a hole in the bench or bench plate, which will hold the shear in an upright position and make the cutting easier. The cutting blades are removable and can be replaced. The capacity is 12 gauge mild steel. It has cutting blades that are 4 inches long, with an overall length of 34 ½ inches.</p>

<h5>Circle snips</h5>
<p>Circle snips (Figure 6-74) have curved blades and are used for making circular cuts, as the name implies. They come in the same sizes and capacities as straight snips and either right- or left-hand types are available.</p>

<h5>Hawk’s bill snips</h5>
<p>Hawk’s bill snips (Figure 6-74) are used to cut a small radius inside and an outside circle. The narrow curved blades are beveled to allow sharp turns without buckling the sheet metal. These snips are useful for cutting holes in pipe, in furnace hoods, and in close quarters work. These snips are available with a 2 ½-inch long cutting edge, having an overall length of 11 ½ or 13 inches, and a 20 gauge mild steel capacity.</p>

<h5>Aviation snips</h5>
<p>Aviation snips (Figure 6-74) have compound levers, enabling them to cut with less effort. These snips have hardened blades that enable them to cut hard material. They are also useful for cutting circles, squares, compound curves, and intricate designs in sheet metal. Aviation snips come in three types: right hand, left hand, and straight. On right-hand snips, the blade is on the left and they cut to the left. Left-hand snips are the opposite. They are usually color-coded in keeping with industry standards– green cuts right, red cuts left, yellow cuts straight. Both snips can be used with the right hand. The snips are 10 inches long, have a 2-inch cut, and have a 16 gauge mild steel capacity.</p>

<h5>Trojan snips</h5>
<p>Trojan snips (Figure 6-74) are slim-bladed snips that are used for straight or curved cutting. The blades are small enough to allow sharp turning cuts without buckling the metal. These snips can be used to cut outside curves and can also be used in place of circle snips, hawk’s bill snips, or aviation snips when cutting inside curves. The blades are forged high-grade steel. These snips come in two sizes: one has a 2 ½-inch cutting length and an overall 12-inch length and the other has a 3-inch cutting length and an overall 13-inch length. They both have a 20 gauge capacity.</p>

<h5>Pipe & Duct snips (Double Cut)</h5>
<p>Pipe & Duct snips (Figure 6-74) have a straight cut blade pattern. This type of aviation snip cuts a narrow section equal to the width of the center blade as it cuts. The material on either side of the cut tends to stay flat, as only the narrow section takes a curl as it is cut. This style can be used in stovepipe and downspout work where distortion on either side of the cut is not desirable.</p>

<h5>Nibbler</h5>
<p>The nibbler (Figure 6-74) is for cutting sheet metal with minimal distortion. One type operates much like a punch and die, with a blade that moves in a linear fashion against a fixed die, removing small bits of metal and leaving a kerf approximately 6 mm wide. Another type operates similar to tin snips, but shears the sheet along two parallel tracks 3 to 6 mm apart, rolling up the waste in a tight spiral as it cuts. Nibblers may be manual (hand-operated) or powered.</p>

<h5>Tinner’s Bench Shears</h5>
<p>The tinner’s bench shear (Figure 6-75) is larger than a hand shear and is used for cutting heavy sheet metal. The lower handle has a hook which can be placed in a hole in the bench so the operator will have a free hand to guide the work. The bench shear makes a 6- inch cut and is approximately 36 inches long.</p>

<h5>Metal Shearing Machine</h5>
<p>The metal shearing machine (Figure 6-76) is foot-operated and is used to cut original sheets into smaller, usable size stock. The shear blade is 36 inches long and will cut all sheet metal up to and including 1/16 of an inch of mild steel or 1/8 of an inch of iron.</p>

 	 
<figure data-id="6-77" class="">Cutting nippers.
</figure>
<h5>Cutting Nippers</h5>
<p>The cutting nippers (Figure 6-77) are similar to the end cutting pliers. Nippers are used to cut protruding metal flush with a surface. They are also used to cut wire, bolts, nails, and light metal bars to specified dimensions. Nippers come in a variety of styles and sizes.</p>

<h4>Using Cutting Nippers</h4>

<p>The following steps describe how to use cutting nippers properly:</p>

<h5>Wire Cutting</h5>
<ol>
   <li>Place the wire on the table and measure the section to be cut off.</li>
    
    <li>Mark it with pencil, chalk, soapstone, or other suitable marking piece.</li>
     
    <li>Take the nippers in your hand and place the cutting edge on the mark (Figure 6-78).</li>
    
    <li>Squeeze the handles together slowly, exerting enough pressure to cut the wire.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat procedure for as many pieces of wire needed to be cut.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Shears and Nippers</h4>
<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with shears and nippers:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Keep fingers, hands, and other parts of the body clear of the cutting edges of bench shears, the shearing machine, hand shears, and nippers.</li>
    
    <li>Do not carry shears or nippers in your pocket.</li>
    
    <li>Always steady the work that is to be cut.</li>
    
    <li>After use, be sure to hang the tools or store them in their proper place.</li>
    
    <li>Keep tools clean at all times. Lubricate the pivot screw or bolt with a drop of light oil.</li>
    
    <li>Remove rust with a fine aluminum-oxide abrasive cloth.</li>
    
    <li>Apply a thin film of oil on tools to prevent rust, and hang tools on hooks or place them on a shelf when not in use.</li>
    
    <li>Do not throw cutting tools together in a box where the cutting edges may be damaged.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use the shearing machine table as a storage place for other tools and work.</li>
    
    <li>Do not attempt to cut material heavier than the tools or machines are designed to handle.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use shears or nippers as hammers or pry bars, as they are easily damaged.</li>
    
    <li>Dull shears can usually be sharpened on an oilstone or with a file.</li>
 
 
   <div class="alert alert-caution">Do not use grinders on shears if sharpening is all that is necessary. Most shears become useless after two or three times of sharpening.
    </div>
 

<li>Sharpen the shears and nippers only if the cutting edges become nicked, damaged, or distorted from improper sharpening or prolonged use.</li>

<li>For long-term storage, coat tools with a rust-preventive compound and store in a dry place where the cutting edges will not come in contact with other metal objects.</li>

</ul>

<h3>BRUSH-CUTTING TOOLS</h3>
<figure data-id="6-80" class="">Brush hook.</figure>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>When it is not practical to use an ax or other conventional cutting tool, a brush-cutting tool can be used. Brush-cutting tools are used for cutting underbrush, shrubs, tree branches, vines, and tall grass. Two of the most common brush-cutting tools are the brush hook and the machete. Brush- cutting tools are available in various sizes and designs depending on the nature of use.</p>

<h5>Brush Hook</h5>
<p>The brush hook (Figure 6-80) is a hook-shaped steel blade set onto a heavy- duty metal or wooden handle. The inside edge of the hooked blade is sharpened like the cutting edge of an ax blade. The brush hook is used for cutting underbrush, shrubs, or branches. Tool size and design vary according to the task.</p>

<figure data-id="6-81" class="">Machete.</figure>

<h5>Machete</h5>
<p>The machete (Figure 6-81) used in the military is typically 18 inches long. The widest and heaviest portion is at the point of the blade. The blade is attached to a handle shaped to fit the hand. The handle is designed with a slight projection to prevent the machete from slipping from the hand while being used. The machete is used to cut tall grass, vines, and small brush.</p>

<h4>Using the Brush Hook</h4>

 <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear proper eye protection when working where flying particles may cause eye injury.
    </div>
 
<p>The following steps describe how to use a brush hook properly:</p>
<ol>
   <li>To use the brush hook on a tree branch (Figure 6-82), lift the curve of the hook above the branch and make short, chopping strokes downward against the surface of the branch.</li>
    
    <li>To cut small brush or bushes (Figure 6-83), swing the brush hook horizontally. The hooked portion will keep the brush from bouncing away from the cutting edge.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Brush-Cutting Tools</h4>
<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with brush-cutting tools:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Always make sure no one is close enough to be injured before swinging the tool.</li>
    
    <li>Take care not to allow branches or brush in line of swing to deflect the stroke and cause injury.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use a dull or defective tool.</li>
    
    <li>Store tools properly when not in use. Repair all nicks and dulled cutting edges immediately.</li>
    
    <li>For prolonged storage, coat metal parts with light oil.</li>
    
    <li>Replace defective handle immediately.</li></ul>
