<h3>SAWS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<p>Saws are tools with thin flat steel blades that have a row of spaced notches or “teeth” along the edge. The blade is fastened to a handle. Saws are available in various sizes and designs depending on their use and the material to be cut. The most common types of saws are handsaw (crosscut and ripsaw), one-man crosscut saw, two-man crosscut saw, backsaw, nest-of-saws, compass (keyhole) saw, coping saw, dovetail saw, and hacksaw.</p>

<h5>Handsaw</h5>
<figure data-id="6-1" class="">Parts of a saw.</figure>

<p>The handsaw consists of a thin flat blade with teeth and a wooden or plastic handle (Figure 6-1), called the heel, fastened to the end of the blade by screws. The handsaw is used in carpentry, rough-out work, and for “finish” hand sawing. Sizes of handsaws vary depending on design and nature of the task. There are two categories of handsaws: the ripsaw and the crosscut.
        The ripsaw, has large chisel-shaped teeth, usually 5 1/2
        teeth per inch. It is designed to cut with the wood grain,
    with teeth that are cross-filed to ensure the chisel point is set square to the direction of cutting. The ripping action of this saw produces a coarse ragged cut not desirable for finish work.</p>
<p>The crosscut saw has teeth shaped like knife points to crumble out wood between cuts. It is designed to cut across wood grain and produces a smoother cut than ripsaws. They can also be used to cut plywood.
    </p>
    
   
  <h5>One-Man Crosscut Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-2" class="">One-man crosscut saw.</figure>

<p>The one-man crosscut saw (Figure 6-2) is about 36 inches long and has a handle at one end. This type of saw is characterized by a high-grade steel blade with two types of teeth known as cutters and rakers. The cutters do the cutting, and the rakers chisel out and remove chips from the cut. It is used for heavy work such as cutting down trees and sawing heavy timbers.</p>

<h5>Two-Man Crosscut Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-3" class="">Two-man crosscut saw.</figure>

<p>The two-man crosscut saw (Figure 6-3) is 5 to 6 1/2 feet long with a handle at each end. As with the one-man crosscut saw, it also has a high-grade steel blade with the cutter and raker teeth arrangement. It is used when two men are required for extra heavy cutting jobs.</p>

<h5>Backsaw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-4" class="">Backsaw.</figure>

<p>The backsaw (Figure 6-4) has a straight blade and parallel top and bottom, with a heavy strip of steel or brass wrapped along the back to provide rigidity. The handle is of similar shape to other handsaws except it is usually mounted higher. Backsaws are used for general bench work such as cutting joints and smaller sections of lumber to length. Sizes vary depending on design and nature of work.</p>

<h5>Nest-of-Saws</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-5" class="">Nest-of-saws.</figure>

<p>Nest-of-saws (Figure 6-5) consist of a wooden handle to which several different blades can be attached, making up different types of saws such as the keyhole or compass saw. A slotted end at the heel of each blade slips into the pistol-grip type handle where a wingnut fastens it in place. Nest-of- saws are used to cut along curved lines, to start cuts for larger saws, or to make starting saw cuts from drilled holes or small openings. The size of these saws will vary depending on design and nature of use.</p>


<h5>Compass (Keyhole) Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-6" class="">Compass (keyhole) saw.</figure>

<p>The compass saw (Figure 6-6) has a narrow blade that tapers nearly to a point. This point helps it to fit in tight spaces where larger saws would not fit.
    There are three or four blade styles that can be changed according to the cutting job. It cuts curves quickly in wood and wallboard.</p>
<p>A keyhole saw is a small compass saw with finer teeth, used to cut metal. Keyhole saw blades can come in a turret head model that can be rotated and locked in several positions to ease cutting in tight spots.</p>

<h5>Coping Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-7" class="">Coping saw.</figure>

<p>The coping saw (Figure 6-7) has a narrow flexible blade attached to a U-shaped frame. Blade holders at each end of the frame can be rotated so it can cut at any angle.
    This saw is used for cutting irregular shapes, curves, and intricate decorative patterns.</p>

<h5>Dovetail Saw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-8" class="">Dovetail saw.</figure>

<p>The dovetail saw (Figure 6-8) is similar to a backsaw with its stiff reinforced back, but it is smaller with finer teeth. It is used for fine finish cuts, such as dovetail joints. It is commonly used for trimming molding and repairing furniture. It can also be used to cut plastics and laminates.</p>

<h5>Hacksaw</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-9" class="">Hacksaw.</figure>

<p>The hacksaw (Figure 6-9) is designed to cut almost any size or shape of metal object. The hacksaw uses two types of blades, hard and flexible. The type of blade used depends on the nature of the task. The blade is held to the saw frame by pins that fit into small holes at each end of the blade. Blade tension is adjusted by a screw and wingnut assembly at either the nose or the handle end of the frame. The hacksaw comes in various designs, depending on the purpose.

    <h4>Using the Crosscut Saw</h4>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying wood chips.
    </div>
    
    <p>The following steps describe how to use a crosscut saw properly:</p>
<ol><li>In using the crosscut saw, place the work on a level just below the knees. Place one sawhorse, bench, or other support fairly close to the line of cut.</li>
     
    <li>Begin the cut by placing your hand with the thumb in an upright position pressed against the blade away from the teeth (Figure 6-10).</li>
    <li>Start sawing slowly to prevent the blade from jumping off the cut line.</li>
    <li>After the blade is engaged, use partial cutting strokes and be sure to set the saw at the proper angle (Figure 6-11).</li>
    <li>During the cut, apply pressure only during the down stroke.</li>
    <li>When nearing the end of a cut, hold the waste side of the wood to prevent board breaking off unevenly.</li></ol>

 <h4>Using the Keyhole Saw</h4>

<p>The following steps describe how to use a keyhole saw properly:
    </p>
  <ol>
     <li>To make an inside-out cut, first drill a hole large enough to admit the point of the saw (Figure 6-12).</li>
     <li>Insert the saw blade and start to cut slowly (Figure 6-13), with a minimum of pressure.</li>
     <li>Be careful not to twist the blade too sharply, as the narrow blade will easily bend.</li>
  </ol>
  <figure data-id="6-12" class="">Drill a hole.</figure>
  <figure data-id="6-13" class="">Insert the saw blade.</figure>

<h4>Using the Hacksaw</h4>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear protective eyewear to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div>
 
<p>The following steps describe how to use a hacksaw properly:</p>

<ol><li>Insert the correct blade in the hacksaw frame and adjust the wingnut for proper tension.</li>
<li>Secure the material to be cut in a vise or other holding device to avoid vibration which may snap the blade.</li>
<li>To make an accurate cut, use a file to make a notch for guiding the first strokes of the saw (Figure 6-14).</li>
<li>Steady the saw by holding the handle with the right hand and the frame with the left.</li>
<li>Hold the blade parallel to the work surface and cut on the push stroke (Figure 6-15), being careful not to bear down too hard. Draw the blade back using no pressure each time.</li>
<li>Saw at a rate not to exceed 40 to 50 strokes per minute.</li></ol>

  <figure data-id="6-15" class="">Hold the blade parallel.</figure>
  
  <h4>Care of Saws</h4>
<p>Observe the following guidelines when working with saws:</p>
<ul>

<li>Always wear eye protection; either safety glasses or a face shield.</li>
<li>Make sure the teeth and blades are properly sharpened and set by a qualified professional; dull teeth can be a safety hazard.</li>
<li>Make sure the saw blade is clean and protected from rust. Use emery cloth to clean the blade and a coat of light machine oil to prevent rust.</li>
    <li>Lay the saw down gently.</li>
    <li>Keep the handsaw teeth away from contact with stone, concrete, or metal.</li>
     
    <li>Protect the teeth of any saw when the tool is not in use.</li>
    <li>Before using, inspect the tool. Do not use any damaged or broken saw.</li>
    <li>Store all tools in their proper places when not being used.</li>
    <li>Do not throw or drop any tools. If a saw is dropped, inspect immediately before reusing.</li>
    <li>Replace damaged saw handles with new ones immediately when needed.</li>
    <li>Always loosen the blade tension on a hacksaw when not in use.</li>
    <li>Always remove the nest-of-saw blade from the handle for storage.</li>
    <li>Choose a saw that is the right size and design for the type of material being cut.</li>
    <li>Brace yourself when you are sawing so the final cut doesn’t throw you off balance.</li>
    <li>Make sure the saw handle keeps your wrist in a natural position-horizontal to the piece being cut.</li>
    <li>Make sure the piece being cut is free of objects, such as screws or nails, which could make the saw buckle.</li>
    <li>When cutting longer stock, be sure the stock is properly supported.</li>
    <li>Use clamps or vises to steady or secure any loose material to be cut.</li>
    <li>Do not allow pointed or edged tools to lie around where they may injure someone.</li>
    <li>Be careful not to allow the fingers or other parts of the body to get in the line of cut.</li>
    <li>Do not use a tool for any purpose other than that for which it was designed.</li>
    <li>Avoid placing heavy tools or objects on saw blades as these objects can distort the blade.</li>
    <li>Do not force the saw if it binds. Use a wedge to spread the cut.</li>
    
    </ul>

  
  
 <h3>CHISELS</h3>
<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Woodworker's Chisels</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-16" class="">Socket-type chisel.</figure>

<p>There are two types of woodworker’s chisels, the socket- and tang-type. The socket-type (Figure 6-16) has a blade and socket handle forged of high carbon steel in a single casting. The wooden handle is inserted into the socket. This type of chisel is used to cut and pare off wood. Generally, socket-type chisels are used for heavier cutting when a hammer or mallet may be required for additional driving force.</p>
  <figure data-id="6-17" class="">Tang-type chisel.</figure>

<p>The tang-type chisel (Figure 6-17) is forged in a single casting. The handle is drilled and inserted over the tang and reinforced with a metal band. The tang-type chisels are also used to cut and pare wood. However, the driving force required is hand pressure only.</p>
 
<h5>Machinists’ Chisels</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-18" class="">Common shapes of chisels.</figure>

<p>Machinists’ chisels are classified according to the shape of their points, and the width of the cutting edge denotes their size. The most common shapes of chisels (Figure 6-18) are cold chisel, cape, round nose, and diamond point. Chisels are designed to cut and shape cold metal and are usually struck with a hammer. The flat or cold chisel is composed of hardened steel and has a tapered cutting edge on one end and a flat base on the other end.</p>
<p>The diamond point chisel (Figure 6-18) has a solid point on one end and a flat base on the other end. It is used for drawing and cutting holes in flat stocks and to cut V-grooves.</p>
<p>The cape chisel (Figure 6-18) has a small solid point on one end and a flat base on the other end. It is used for cutting keyways or slots in metal and square corners.</p>
<p>The round nose chisel (Figure 6-18) has a ground edge on one end, a flat base on the other end, and an octagon-shaped stock. It is used to align drilled holes, cut channels, cut oil grooves, and similar work.</p>

<h5>Track Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-19" class="">Track chisel.</figure>

<p>The track chisel (Figure 6-19) has a beveled point on one end and a flat face on the other end. The cutting edge is 1 3/8 inches wide; the overall length is 10 1/2 inches and it weighs 5 1/2 pounds. The track chisel is used with a 22-inch sledge hammer to remove track bolts, boiler rivet heads, and cut rail when a saw or cutting torch is not available.</p>

<h5>Rivet Buster Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-20" class="">Rivet buster chisel.</figure>

<p>The rivet buster chisel (Figure 6-20) has a single ground flat cutting edge on one end and a flat face on the other end. The cutting edge is about 3/4 of an inch wide and the overall length is about 9 inches. It is used for cutting off chassis rivets and in other difficult places which cannot be reached by other chisels.</p>

<h5>Masonry Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-21" class="">Masonry chisel.</figure>

<p>The masonry chisel (Figure 6-21) is used to cut masonry, such as concrete block and brick. There are also masonry chisels with teeth used for cutting soft stone.</p>

<h5>Flooring Chisel</h5>
  <figure data-id="6-22" class="">Flooring chisel.</figure>

<p>The flooring chisel (Figure 6-22) is used to remove flooring material. It has a larger head to increase the striking area.</p>

<h4>Using a Woodworker’s Chisel</h4>
     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection. Keep both hands back from the cutting edge at all times.
    </div>
<p>
 Use the wood chisel to make openings or notches in wooden material. Use the chisel to make a recess for butt-type hinges, such as door hinges. Follow these steps to use a wood chisel properly:</p>
  <figure data-id="6-23" class="">Using a woodworker’s chisel.</figure>

<ol><li>Use a pencil to outline the opening or recess to be chiseled.</li>
     
     <li>Set the chisel at one end of the outline. The edge of the chisel should be on the cross-grain line. The bevel should be facing the recess to be made.</li>
     
     <li>Strike the head of the chisel lightly with a mallet.</li>
     
     <li>Repeat the process at the other end of the outline, with the bevel of the chisel blade toward the recess.</li>
     
     <li>Make a series of cuts about 1/4 of an inch apart from one end of the recess to the other.</li>
     
     <li>Trim away the notched wood. Hold the chisel bevel-side down to slice inward from the end of the recess (Figure 6-23).</li>
     </ol>
 
<h4>Using a Machinist’s Cold Chisel</h4>
     <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-note">The following procedure is designed for using a machinist’s cold chisel. However, cutting round stock is not the only use for this type of chisel.
    </div>   
<p>A cold chisel is used to cut metal, as long as that metal is softer than the steel that the chisel is made of. You can use it to cut rivets, nuts, and bolts made of brass, bronze, copper, or iron.</p>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a machinist’s cold chisel properly:</p>

<ol><li>Secure the material you need to cut in a vise.</li>
    <li>Use a holding tool to place the blade of the chisel where you want to cut the material.</li>
    <li>Hit the chisel handle with a ball peen hammer to force the chisel into and through the material (repeat if necessary).</li></ol>

  <h4>Using a Rivet Buster Chisel</h4>
  
      <div class="alert alert-warning">Wear eye protection to avoid flying metal chips.
    </div> 
  
<p>The following steps describe how to use a rivet buster chisel properly:
      </p>
<ol>
   <li>Place the cutting edge of the chisel firmly against the rivet shaft between the head and the metal (Figure 6-24).</li>
    
    <li>Grip the chisel firmly and strike chisel head with a machinist’s or sledge hammer.</li>
    
    <li>Continue striking chisel head until rivet head has been cut off.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Care of Chisels</h4>
<p>Use these guidelines when working with chisels:</p>

<ul>    <li>Always use eye protection.</li>
        
       <li> Plastic guards near the head of the chisel protect hands against mishits.</li>
        
        <li>Tip guards protect the sharpened tip of the chisel.</li>
        
        <li>Keep all chisels sharpened and in good working order. Sharpen the cutting edge of a chisel on an oilstone to produce a keen edge.</li>
        
     <ul>
     <li>Make sure the wood chisel blade is beveled at a precise 25-degree angle so it will cut well.</li>
     
     <li>Make sure the cold chisel blade is beveled at a 60-degree angle so it will cut well.</li>
     </ul>
     </ul>
    
<ul><li>Strike cold chisels only with a hand drilling, ball peen, or similar heavy hammer.</li>
    <li>The face diameter of the hammer should be about three-eighths of an inch larger than the chisel head.</li>
    <li>Discard any chisel with a cracked or chipped face.</li>
    <li>Discard any chisel with a head that is mushroomed or flattened.</li>
    <li>Use chisels for the appropriate purpose and in the correct way. Avoid the following:</li>
<ul><li>Using a cold chisel to cut or split stone or concrete.</li>
    <li>Using a wood chisel to cut metal, concrete, or stone.</li>
    <li>Using a chisel for prying or driving screws.</li>
    <li>Placing a chisel of any type in your pocket.</li></ul>
     
    <li>Store in racks or where they may not be chipped or broken.</li>
    <li>Lubricate with a light coat of oil before storing.</li>
    <li>Regrind broken or chipped edges before using.</li></ul>
