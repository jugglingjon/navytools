<h3>PLANES</h3>
<p>Planes are smoothing tools used to true edges or surfaces of wood. Planes are also used where a finished surface or close-fitting joint is required. Planes vary in size and shape, but each is designed for a specific purpose. There are several types, including jointer and fore planes, jack planes, smooth planes, block planes, and rabbet planes. The parts of a plane are shown in Figure 8-1.</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Jack Plane</h5>
<p>The jack plane is illustrated in Figure 8-1. This plane is used for general smoothing of edges and sizing of wood. The name comes from the saying, “Jack of all trades,” since this plane performs the work of both smooth planes and jointer planes. It is usually about 15 inches long with a blade that has a moderately curved edge. When stock is prepared, the jack plane is used after the scrub plane and before the smooth plane.</p>
   
    <figure data-id="8-2" class="">Jointer plane.</figure>

<h5>Jointer Plane</h5>
<p>The jointer plane (Figure 8-2) is used to straighten the edges of boards in an operation known as jointing. It is also used to flatten the face of a board. The jointer plane is usually 20 to 24 inches long. A similar, but shorter, plane about 18 inches long is known as a fore plane.</p>
    
    <figure data-id="8-3" class="">Scrub plane.</figure>

<h5>Scrub Plane</h5>
<p>The scrub plane (Figure 8-3) is used to remove large amounts of wood from the surface of lumber in the first stages of preparing rough stock, or when the thickness of the board needs to be reduced significantly. Unlike most planes, it is used in diagonal strokes across the face of a board.</p>
   
    <figure data-id="8-4" class="">Smooth plane.</figure>

<h5>Smooth Plane</h5>
<p>The smooth plane (Figure 8-4) is the last plane used on a wood surface. With proper use, the finish from a smooth plane is much better than the finish achieved with sandpaper or scrapers. This smooth finish comes from planing the wood off in strips. The smooth plane is 9 to 10 inches long and is meant to be used with two hands.</p>
   
    <figure data-id="8-5" class="">Block plane.</figure>

<h5>Block Plane</h5>
<p>The block plane (Figure 8-5) is the smallest hand plane. The block plane’s plane iron is set at a much lower angle than that of other planes. It is used to plane across the grain at the ends of boards, otherwise known as blocking in. It is also used to shave thin pieces of wood from small surfaces in awkward areas. This plane is small enough to use with one hand, sometimes at an angle of as much as 45 degrees. A toe knob is provided when additional pressure is needed.</p>
The block plane is a tool with many uses, including cleaning up components to make them fit within fine tolerances. Rounding square edges, otherwise known as chamfering, and removing glue lines are some other uses for this plane.
 
    <figure data-id="8-6" class="">Rabbet plane.</figure>

<h5>Rabbet Plane</h5>
<p>The rabbet plane (Figure 8-6) is used to make rabbet joints on the ends of boards. The blade on this plane protrudes by a very small amount from the sides of the plane so that the plane doesn’t bind on the side of the cut. This helps make the side of the rabbet joint perpendicular to the bottom. This plane is used for long grain cutting and is meant to remove large amounts of material quickly.</p>


<h4>Using the Block Plane</h4>

         </div>
 
<p>The following steps describe how to use a block plane properly:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Secure the work with a vise or with clamps to prevent slippage.</li>
    
    <li>Ensure that the cutting blade is extremely sharp and set to produce a fine cut.</li>
    
    <li>Place the plane on the edge of the board with the plane pointing across the grain (Figure 8-7).</li>
    
   <li> Push along the length of the board with a steady, even stroke.</li>
            
         <div class="alert alert-note">To prevent the grain from splitting, plane from either end or plane a chamfer on the far end first.
         </div>
         
    <li>If necessary, create a chamfer to prevent the grain from splitting (Figure 8-8).</li>
    
    <li>Raise the plane from the work after each stroke and return to the starting point.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat the process until the task is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    </div>
 
<p>The following steps describe how to use a bench plane properly:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Secure the work with a vise or with clamps to prevent slippage.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure the plane is sharp and properly adjusted before using.</li>
    
    <li>Place the plane on the board with the right hand on the handle and the left hand on the knob.</li>
    
    <div class="alert alert-note">Reverse the position of the hands if left-handed.
    </div>
    
    <li>Ensure the plane is placed on the work so that the wood grain points in the direction the plane will go.</li>
    
    <li>Push with a steady, even stroke along the length of the board (Figure 8-9).</li>
    
    <li>Raise the plane and return to the starting point after each stroke.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat the process until the task is complete.</li></ol>
    
 <figure data-id="8-9" class="">Using a bench plane.</figure>

<h4>Care of Planes</h4>
<p>Use these guidelines when working with planes:</p>
    
<ul>
   <li>Be careful to plane work smoothly to avoid splinters that may be left to cause injury.</li>
    
    <li>Use each plane only for the job it is intended.</li>
    
    <li>Keep all cutting tools in good condition.</li>
    
    <li>Do not allow tools to lie around work areas in such a position that they may cause injury to others.</li>
    
    <li>Before using, inspect the tool for damage or other defects. Repair or replace immediately if necessary.</li>
    
   <li>Place the plane on its side to protect the cutting edge when not in use.</li>
    
    <li>Keep the cutting edge sharp and free of nicks.</li>
    
    <li>Cover all metal parts with light oil to prevent rusting.</li>
    
    <li>For storage, withdraw the cutting edge into the mouth of the plane.</li></ul>
 
<h3>SCRAPERS</h3>
<p>Scrapers are made in different shapes for various types of work. Some scrapers are used for truing metal, wood, and plastic surfaces which have been machined or filed. Other scrapers are made to remove paint, stencil markings, and other coatings from various surfaces.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-10" class="">Carbon scraper.</figure>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>
<h5>Carbon Scraper</h5>
<p>A carbon scraper (Figure 8-10) is used to clean carbon from cylinder heads, pistons, and other metal surfaces. It is flexible and has an overall length of approximately 9 inches. The carbon scraper consists of ten round spring steel blades, and their flexibility is controlled by a sliding ferrule.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-11" class="">Box scraper.</figure>

<h5>Box Scraper</h5>
<p>Box scrapers (Figure 8-11) are usually used to scrape stencil markings from wood surfaces. They are also used as wood floor scrapers. The box scraper has a 2-inch blade and a 9-inch handle hinged at the blade. The bottom of the scraper and the edge of the cutter are convex so that corners do not scratch up the work. The blade can be adjusted by loosening the thumbscrew and extending or withdrawing the blade in its holder.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-12" class="">Flat blade scraper.</figure>

<h5>Flat Blade Scraper</h5>
<p>Flat blade scrapers (Figure 8-12) are used for removing high spots from flat surfaces only.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-13" class="">Bearing scraper.</figure>

<h5>Bearing Scraper</h5>
<p>Bearing scrapers (Figure 8-13) are used to scrape Babbitt metal bearings. Bearing scrapers come with 11/2-, 2-, and 4-inch cutting edges.</p>
<h5>Triangular Blade Scraper</h5>
<p>Triangular blade scrapers (Figure 8-14) are used for removing high spots from flat or curved surfaces. They are available with either a 4- or 6-inch blade.</p>
 
  <figure data-id="8-14" class="">Triangular blade scraper.</figure>

<h4>Using a Bearing Scraper</h4>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a bearing scraper properly (Figure 8-15):</p>

  <figure data-id="8-15" class="">Using a bearing scraper.</figure>
<ol>
   <li>Place the bearing to be scraped on a bench or other suitable working surface.</li>
    
    <li>Use both hands on the bearing scraper. One hand should be at the end of the handle while the other hand steadies the tool.</li>
    
    <li>Use the hand at the end of the handle to twist the tool. Use very light pressure and remove a small amount of metal with the twisting stroke. If too much pressure is applied, the scraper will chatter and leave a rough uneven surface.</li>
    
    <li>Start at one top side of bearing cap. Work down, and then up to the top of the other side. Do not scrape lengthwise.</li>
    
    <li>Repeat procedure until the required amount of material has been removed to fit the bearing onto the shaft.</li></ol>

<h4>Care of Scrapers</h4>
<p>Use these guidelines when working with scrapers:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Keep work, scraper, and hands free from grease and oil when using a scraper.</li>
    
    <li>Keep scrapers sharp at all times (except the carbon scrapers) since a dull scraper is more apt to slip and cause injury.</li>
    
    <div class="alert alert-note">Carbon scraper blades are fairly dull to prevent scoring of a piston and/or cylinder wall.
    </div>
    
    <li>Use the scrapers only for their intended purposes.</li>
    
    <li>When a scraper is not in use, coat the blade with a film of light oil.</li>
    
    <li>Hang or store scrapers separately to protect the cutting edge. Do not throw scrapers in with other tools. This will damage the cutting edges.</li>
    
    <li>For long-term storage, coat all metal parts with rust-preventive compound and store in a dry place.</li></ul>

<figure data-id="8-16" class="">Parts of a file.</figure>

<h3>FILES</h3>
<p>Files are used for cutting, smoothing off, or removing small amounts of metal, wood, plastic, or other material. Files are made in various lengths, shapes, and cuts. Every file has five parts (Figure 8-16): the point, edge, face or cutting teeth, heel or shoulder, and tang. The tang is used to attach the handle on American pattern files. The tang is shaped into a handle and is usually knurled on Swiss pattern files.</p>

<h4>Types and Uses</h4>

<figure data-id="8-17" class="">American file pattern.</figure>

<h5>American Pattern File</h5>
<p>Files are graded according to the degree of fineness and whether they have single- or double- cut teeth. The differences among file types are apparent as shown in Figure 8-17. Single-cut files have rows of teeth cut parallel to each other.
    These teeth are set at an angle of about 65 degrees with the centerline. Single-cut files are used for sharpening tools, finish filing, and draw filing. They are also the best tools for smoothing the edges of sheet metal. Files with crisscrossed rows of teeth are double-cut files. The double cut forms teeth that are diamond-shaped and fast cutting. Double-cut files are used for quick removal of metal and for rough work.</p>
<p>Files are also graded according to the spacing and size of their teeth, or their coarseness and fineness. Some of these grades are pictured in Figure 8-17. In addition to the three grades shown, dead smooth files (with very fine teeth) and some rough files (with very coarse teeth) may be used. The fineness or coarseness of file teeth is also influenced by the length of the file. The length of a file is the distance from the tip to the heel, and does not include the tang (Figure 8-17). By comparing the actual size of the teeth of a 6- inch, single-cut smooth file with a 12-inch, single- cut smooth file; the 6-inch file has more teeth per inch than the 12-inch file.</p>

<figure data-id="8-18" class="">Mill file.</figure>

<h5>Mill File</h5>
<p>Mill files (Figure 8-18) are tapered in both width and thickness. One edge has no teeth and is known as a safe edge. Mill files are used for smoothing lathe work, draw filing, and other fine, precision work. Mill files are always single-cut.</p>

<figure data-id="8-19" class="">Pillar file.</figure>

<h5>Pillar File</h5>
<p>Pillar files (Figure 8-19) are similar to hand files in general shape, but are much narrower. They are double-cut with one uncut edge. Pillar files are used to file in slots and keyways.</p>
 
 <figure data-id="8-20" class="">Round file.</figure>

<h5>Round File</h5>
<p>Round files (Figure 8-20) will taper slightly
    toward the point. Bastard-cut files 6 inches and	 
    longer are double-cut. The second-cut files, 12 inches and longer, are double-cut. All others are single-cut. Round files are used for filing circular openings or concave surfaces.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-21" class="">Square file.</figure>

<h5>Square File</h5>
<p>Square files (Figure 8-21) taper slightly toward the point on all four sides and are double-cut. They are used for filing rectangular slots and keyways.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-22" class="">Taper file.</figure>

<h5>Taper File</h5>
<p>Taper files (Figure 8-22), or triangular files, are tapered toward the point on all three sides.
    They are used for filing saws having 60-degree angled teeth. Taper files come in regular, slim, extra slim, and double extra slim and usually are single-cut.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-23" class="">Three-square file.</figure>

<h5>Three-Square File</h5>
<p>Three-square files (Figure 8-23) are tapered toward the point on all three sides and are double-cut. They are used for filing internal angles, and for cleaning out square corners.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-24" class="">Warding file.</figure>

<h5>Warding File</h5>
<p>Warding files (Figure 8-24) are tapered to a point for narrow space filing. They have double- cut faces and single-cut edges. Warding files are used for lock repair or for filing ward notches in keys.</p>

 <figure data-id="8-25" class="">Curved-tooth file.</figure>

<h5>Curved-Tooth File</h5>
<p>Curved-tooth files (Figure 8-25), also known as mill-toothed files, are general used on flat or curved surfaces of aluminum and sheet steel. They are also used for smooth, rapid work on bronze, lead, Babbitt, zinc, and plastic. Flat, flexible, curved-tooth files do not have tangs and
    are made for easy mounting on a file holder. The file holder is adjustable for concave or convex surfaces. Flat, flexible, curved-tooth files come in fine-cut and standard-cut teeth.
    Flat, rigid, curved-tooth files are self-cleaning and used for filing flat surfaces on cast iron, lead, Babbitt, aluminum, zinc, and plastic. They come in smooth-cut and standard-cut teeth.</p>
<p>Half-round, rigid, curved-tooth files are flat on one side and convex on the other. They are used for filing concave surfaces and bearings. They come with standard-cut teeth.</p>
 
  <figure data-id="8-26" class="">Swiss pattern file.</figure>

<h5>Swiss Pattern File</h5>
<p>Swiss pattern files (Figure 8-26) are made to more exact measurements than American pattern files. They are primarily finishing tools used on all sorts of delicate and intricate parts. Swiss pattern files come in a variety of styles, shapes, sizes, and double- and single- cuts to ensure precision smoothness.</p>
<p>These files are usually supplied in sets. The most common set consists of twelve assorted files in a set, which are marking (half-round), square, slitting, knife, joint (round edge), crossing (oval), barrette, flat, equaling, three-square (triangular), and round.</p>
<p>Swiss pattern files are made in seven cuts–numbers 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. They are most often used for fitting parts of delicate mechanisms and for tool and die work.</p>

<h4>Using a File</h4>
<h5>Selecting the Proper File</h5>
<p>Use these guidelines when selecting the proper file:</p>
    
<ul>
   <li>For heavy rough cutting, use a large, coarse, double-cut file.</li>
    
    <li>For finishing cuts, use a second- or smooth-cut, single-cut file.</li>
    
    <li>When working on cast iron, start with a bastard-cut file and finish with a second-cut file.</li>
    
    <li>When filing soft metal, start with a second-cut file and finish with a smooth-cut file.</li>
    
    <li>When filing hard steel, start with a smooth-cut file and finish with a dead-smooth file.</li>
    
    <li>When filing brass or bronze, start with a bastard-cut file and finish with a second- or smooth- cut file.</li>
    
    <li>When filing aluminum, lead, or Babbitt metal, use a standard-cut curved-tooth file.</li>
    
    <li>For small work, use a short file. For medium-sized work, use an 8-inch file. For large work, use a file that is most convenient.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h5>Method of Filing</h5>
<p>The following steps describe how to use a file properly:</p>

<h5>Cross Filing</h5>
<p>In Figure 8-27, view A, a piece of mild steel being cross-filed is illustrated. This means that the file is being moved across the surface of the work in approximately a crosswise direction; alternating as shown in Figure 8-27, view B. For best results, the file should be used with slow, full-length, steady strokes with the operator’s feet spread apart to remain steady. The file cuts as it is pushed, so the return stroke should be eased up to avoid dulling the teeth. Files should also be kept clean.</p>

<h5>Draw Filing</h5>
<p>Draw filing produces a finer surface finish and usually a flatter surface than cross filing. Small parts, as shown in Figure 8-27, view C, are best held in a vise. The file should be held as shown in Figure 8-27, view C, with the arrow indicating the cutting stroke is away from the operator when the handle of the file is held in the right hand. If the handle is held in the left hand, the cutting stroke will be toward the operator.</p>

<h5>Filing Round-Metal Stock</h5>
<p>Figure 8-27, view D, shows that as a file is passed over the surface of round work, its angle with the work is changed. The result is a rocking motion of the file as it passes over the work. This rocking motion permits all the teeth on the file to make contact and cut as they pass over the work's surface, thus keeping the file much cleaner and thereby doing better work.</p>

  <figure data-id="8-27" class="fullWidth">Filing operations.</figure>
 
<h4>Care of Files</h4>
<p>Use these guidelines when working with files:</p>

<ul>
   <li>If a file is designed to be used with a handle, do not attempt to use it without the handle. Holding the sharp tang in your hand while filing can cause serious injury.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use a file for prying. The tang end is soft and it bends easily. The body of the file is hard and very brittle. A light bending force will cause it to snap.</li>
    
    <li>A new file should be broken in by using it first on brass, bronze, or smooth iron.</li>
    
    <li>Never use a new file to remove the fins or scales on cast iron.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use a new file on a narrow surface such as sheet metal, because the narrow edge of the metal is likely to break off the sharp points on the file teeth.</li>
    
    <li>Avoid using a new file clogged with metal filings (known as pinning), as it will scratch the work. Rubbing chalk between the teeth before filing will prevent pinning.</li>
    
    <li>Clean files often using a file scorer by using a pulling motion while holding the file scorer blade parallel to the rows of teeth. Finish with a file cleaner brush by brushing the file parallel to the rows of teeth.</li>
    
    <li>Do not throw files into a drawer or toolbox where they can rub against each other or against other tools. Store them in separate holders such as clips, straps, or in holes cut in a block of wood.</li>
    
    <li>Never use a file without a securely-attached handle, unless it is of the Swiss pattern type.</li>
    
    <li>Do not use files for any other use except filing.</li>
    
    <li>Never strike the file against a vise or other object to remove filings. Use the file cleaner brush.</li>
    
    <li>Do not hammer on a file. This is very dangerous because the file may shatter.</li>
    
    <li>Do not oil files or treat with rust-preventive compounds as it will cause the file to slide across the work and prevent fast cutting. To prevent rust, wrap each file in a waterproof barrier wrapping paper and place the files in racks or boxes so the faces or edges of the files will not touch each other.</li></ul>

<h5>Replacing the Handle</h5>
<ol>
   <li>To remove a handle, hold the file with one hand. Pull the file from the handle while striking the ferrule end of the handle against the edge of a bench (Figure 8-28).</li>
    
      <div class="alert alert-caution">Never hammer a file into its handle.
    </div>
    
    <li>To install a new handle, insert tang end of the file into the handle socket exerting pressure with your hands.</li>
    
    <li>Tap the handle on a bench top until the file is seated (Figure 8-29).</li></ol>
